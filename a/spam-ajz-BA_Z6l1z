Jcbl.cloud Team, Instagram is awesome for sharing eye-catching images and b=
uilding a juicy company aesthetic, but it=E2=80=99s not great for driving t=
raffic. In fact, it=E2=80=99s really bad at that.
<br/>
<br/>
But last year, Instagram started allowing <strong>business accounts with mo=
re than 10,000 followers to add links to their Stories. </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, eligible brands jumped on this opportunity and saw incredible re=
sults - <strong> some reported a whopping 25% swipe-through rate.</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
Companies and influencers are quickly realizing the sheer profitability of =
Instagram Stories. <strong>=E2=80=9CSwipe ups lead to sign-ups,=E2=80=9D </=
strong> says Digiday. =E2=80=9CWhich is leading more publishers and influen=
cers to use Instagram as an audience acquisition tool.=E2=80=9D
<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you 5 of the major ways brands and influencers can <strong> ben=
efit from "swipe ups.=E2=80=9D </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
Swipe Up to <strong>Sign Up  </strong>- Turn fans into subscribers by addin=
g links to your Stories to get people to sign up for a freebie.
<br/>
<br/>
Swipe Up to<strong> Learn More </strong>- Easily add a call to action to le=
arn more about a concept or product to a Story you=E2=80=99ve already inves=
ted in.
<br/>
<br/>
Swipe Up to<strong> Save Money</strong> - Offering limited-time deals encou=
rages viewers to click through to your site right away. Once they=E2=80=
=99re there, they might well stick around for a while and make a purchase.=
=20
<br/>
<br/>
Swipe Up to<strong> Get Inspired </strong>- If you need to get people to yo=
ur blog =E2=80=93 maybe you want to become an authority in your niche =
=E2=80=93 put together some Story slides to represent your blog posts. Give=
 a teaser in the Story; get your audience to anticipate what you can offer =
and you=E2=80=99ll drive them to your blog.=20
<br/>
<br/>
 Swipe Up to <strong>Win</strong> - Contests are a great way to boost engag=
ement and your follower count. Using Stories to entice people to enter is a=
 more focused, proactive approach than hoping people scroll past your Insta=
gram post and take notice.
<br/>
<br/>
Consumers are craving deeper connections with the brands they interact with=
, and Instagram Story swipe ups are becoming an excellent way to build and =
tighten relationships.=20
