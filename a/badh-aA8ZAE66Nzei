 It’s hard to say the precise moment when CBD, the voguish cannabis derivative, went from being a fidget spinner alternative for stoners to a
mainstream panacea.
Maybe it was in January, when Mandy Moore, hours before the Golden Globes, told Coveteur that she was experimenting with CBD oil to relieve the pain
from wearing high heels. “It could be a really exciting evening,” she said. “I could be floating this year.”
Maybe it was in July, when Willie Nelson introduced a line of CBD-infused coffee beans called Willie’s Remedy. “It’s two of my favorites,
together in the perfect combination,” he said in a statement.
