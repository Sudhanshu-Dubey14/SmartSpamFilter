There were two methods of playing in ancient times. The first, and probably the primitive method, consisted in tossing up and catching the bones on the back of the hand, very much as the game is played today. In ancient Rome, it was called tali (knucklebones): a painting excavated from Pompeii, currently housed in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples, depicts the goddesses Latona, Niobe, Phoebe, Aglaia and Hileaera, with the last two being engaged in playing a game of knucklebones. According to an epigram of Asclepiodotus, astragali were given as prizes to schoolchildren. This simple form of the game was generally only played by women and children, and was called penta litha or five-stones. There were several varieties of this game besides the usual toss and catch; one being called tropa, or hole-game, the object of which was to toss the bones into a hole in the earth. Another was the simple game of odd or even.

The second, probably derivative, form of the game was one of pure chance, the stones being thrown upon a table, either from the hand or from a cup, and the values of the sides upon which they fell were counted. The shape of the pastern bones used for astragaloi as well as for the tali of the Romans, with whom knucklebones was also popular, determined the manner of counting.
Pastern bones

The pastern bone of a sheep, goat, or calf has two rounded ends upon which it cannot stand and two broad and two narrow sides, one of each pair being concave and one convex. The convex narrow side, called chios or "the dog", was counted as 1, the convex broad side as 3, the concave broad side as 4, and the concave narrow side as 6.

Regardless of the total number of jacks in play, the player who gets to the highest game wins. Game one is usually single bounce (onesies through tensies); game two is chosen by whoever "graduates" from game one first, and so on. Some options for subsequent games are "double bounces," "pigs in the pen," "over the fence," "eggs in the basket" (or "cherries in the basket,") "flying Dutchman," "around the world," etc. Some games, such as "Jack be nimble," are short games which are not played in the onesies-to-tensies format.

<span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">Dear,<br />
<br />
What if you could lose 6-14lbs in a week without even thinking about it?<br />
<br />
How about 62lbs in just a few short months without strict dieting or vigorous exercise?<br />
<br />
Well, that&#39;s exactly what a group of women and men were recently able to do in a groundbreaking Italian diet study.<br />
<br />
The lucky volunteers were granted exclusive access to test <a href="http://inviigoratx.icu/clk.2-2d80-293a-7bc34-c63-17f2-0300-154a90cb">this new weight loss nutrient.</a><br />
<br />
And here&#39;s the crazy thing...<br />
<br />
The study participants ate normally, keeping foods they loved and not having to diet.<br />
<br />
They worked out lightly...with brisk walks or other moderate exercise just 3 times a week, and were never in the gym.<br />
<br />
In the end, their transformations were staggering.<br />
<br />
They reported results like...</span><br />
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">14lbs of weight loss in 8 days</span></li>
	<br />
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">62lbs of weight loss in a matter of months</span></li>
	<br />
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">30.1 pounds of AVERAGE fat loss across 50 participants (some lost much more!)</span></li>
	<br />
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">10-14% average fat percentage reduction</span></li>
	<br />
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">Lower blood pressure and blood sugar readings</span></li>
	<br />
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">Dramatically increased energy levels</span></li>
	<br />
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">Over 94% success rate (almost everyone in the study group lost weight)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family:georgia,serif;">And the only real change they made was adding this one nutrient that blasts away fat better than anything I&#39;ve ever seen...<br />
