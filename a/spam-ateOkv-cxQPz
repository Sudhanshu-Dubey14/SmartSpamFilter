MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH BUILDS A BETTER YOU!

Throughout history, people have discovered ways of expanding certain physical characteristics to amplify their beauty or status. Various tribal peoples used a method called traction to gradually transform their bodies: more visible the lips and earlobes, expanded nose and nasal openings, and even lengthening of the neck, the fingers and the reproductive organs.

What they discovered, without knowing why it worked, is that the gradually applied stimulation of traction, or stretching, actually encourages expansion of tissue cells. The significant changes are permanent.

In the recent times and in shocking numbers, millions of men worldwide are concerned about the size and performance of their sexual equipment -- so it stands to reason that science now applies more time, resources and medical brainpower to this field than ever before. Scientists have been studying and evaluating methods for years. Right now, you can benefit from the very latest in these developments and technologies with - ProExtender.

Best yet, ProExtender is now finally available to you without a prescription or doctor's office visit!

Doctors in Europe sought ways to make this process more sophisticated and precise, with the technology specifically designed for the expansion of male reproductive organs. They knew it was possible to build new tissue permanently -- and they wanted to develop a device that would do this safely and effectively to increase length and girth. Furthermore, they also saw the value of the device in treating disorders like Peyronie's disease, which is the medical term for curvature.

Earlier methods mostly involving weights or more primitive processes did offer the potential for new tissue generation, but unfortunately the results were unpredictable at best.

Modern evolution have created new safer, more comfortable systems that give exactly the right amount of traction - gradually increasing over time in a controlled, accurate and easy-to-use device.

The ProExtender system has been extensively tested and was the subject of a thorough study presented at the International Interdisciplinary Symposium on Genitourinary Reconstructive Surgery, in 1998, at Barcelona, Spain. The results were the basis of a published study called "Tractive Elongation of the Penis by Means of Stretching" by Jorn Ege Siana, MD, Scandinavian Clinic of Plastic Surgery, Copenhagen.

Urologists and plastic surgeons have found the device to be so effective, they continue to use it in their clinics and hospitals and now endorse the release of this technology directly to the public.

We are so confident in the proven results of the ProExtender system that we offer a 100% guarant_ee & Risk Free 6-Month Trial!
