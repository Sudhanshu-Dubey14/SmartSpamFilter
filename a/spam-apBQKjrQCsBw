<p style="color:white;font-size:9px">But it does appear to do exactly that.Bonaccio and her team found that adherence to a Mediterranean diet resulted in a 25 percent lower risk of mortality of all-cause death in a large sample of elderly individuals. Additionally, through a meta-analysis of seven other studies on the Mediterranean diet, they found that the closer individuals followed the diet, the greater the health payoff.To reach these conclusions, researchers took a two-pronged approach in their study: Designing their own prospective study of the elderly and the Mediterranean diet based on data from the Moli-sani study, an Italian population cohort study established between 2005 and 2010. They also conducted a meta-analysis of seven other studies that looked at the effects of the Mediterranean diet in elderly populations.For their own prospective study, they recruited a cohort of more than five-thousand individuals age 65 or older in southern Italy, and followed up with these ind
 ividuals for up to eight years, on average.Members of this cohort had their general health assessed, including activity level, cholesterol, BMI, smoking status, and blood pressure. Using a Mediterranean diet score developed by researchers in 2003, researchers assessed how closely individuals adhered to the Mediterranean diet from 0 to 9, with 0 being the least adherent, and 9 being the most.Elderly people who adhered more closely to the diet had better cardiovascular health, and their risk of death from cardiovascular disease was reduced.A single point increase using the Mediterranean diet scale was associated with a five percent reduction in risk of death.&ldquo;The Mediterranean diet lowers overall mortality risk in a dose-response, progressive way. In other words, the more you follow the Mediterranean diet, the greater the gain in terms of mortality risk reduction,&rdquo; said Bonaccio.The traditional Mediterranean diet is characterized by a high intake of fruits, vegetables, and
  legumes; primarily unrefined grains; a high intake of monounsaturated fat (from extr oil); a moderately high intake of fish; low consumption of red meat, poultry, and sugar; moderate dairy consumption &mdash; typically cheese and yogurt; and a moderate intake of ethanol (in the form of wine).However, because the diet is consumed by different peoples and cultures throughout the Mediterranean region, there is a significant variety in the individual components of the diet that are consumed.What&rsquo;s clear is that despite these differences, there is a general benefit to the diet that is greater than the sum of its individual parts.</p>
