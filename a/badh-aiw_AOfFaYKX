Atomic Energy Department building check dam in TN The Department of Atomic =
Energy (DAE) on Monday said the Rs.32.5 crore, 1.19 km long check dam it is=
 building across the Palar river in Tamil Nadu's Kancheepuram district will=
 be ready by March 2020. In a statement issued here, the DAE said the 'Bhoo=
mi Pooja' or the ground-breaking ceremony was performed on Monday for the p=
roject that provides an additional storage capacity of 1,500 million cubic =
metres with two fillings. About 330 hectares of agricultural land would ben=
efit through this scheme, it said. The check dam will have above-surface st=
ructure of 1.5 metre height to store more water and also recharge the water=
 table, while the sub-surface dyke/wall will be built to a depth of eight m=
etres to prevent sea water intrusion and enhance the groundwater recharge i=
n the aquifer. This innovative design was necessary as the conventional che=
ck dam design would not serve the purpose due to its proximity to the sea a=
nd backwaters, the DAE said. On completion of this check dam by March 2020,=
 the water stored and recharged would be used for domestic and agricultural=
 purposes in the surrounding areas. Tamil Nadu Ministers C. Ve. Shanmugam a=
nd P.Benjamin and officials of Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research and=
 Madras Atomic Power Station were present at the ground-breaking ceremony.
