Obama Given Permission To See Inside Your Bedroom!



It wasn't that long ago we discovered Obama authorized a nationwide spy program.

This program is in clear violation of our constitutional rights.

But that doesn't stop him and his goons from digging into your private life.

Worse yet is the Supreme Court gave him permission to do it!

How does it work?

giving the government a very personal view of your life.
Computers, phones, and smart TVs with built in cameras can be turned on remotely...

That's right, your faithful government has invented new ways to spy on you.

P.S. Did you know the government's been turning simple streetlights into spy tools? You'll never believe what a seemingly simple streetlight can do now. See it, and other normal things the government uses.

n the 1050s and early 1060s William became a contender for the throne of England, then held by the childless Edward the Confessor, his first cousin once removed. There were other potential claimants, including the powerful English earl Harold Godwinson, who was named the next king by Edward on the latter's deathbed in January 1066. William argued that Edward had previously promised the throne to him, and that Harold had sworn to support William's claim. William built a large fleet and invaded England in September 1066, decisively defeating and killing Harold at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066. After further military efforts William was crowned king on Christmas Day 1066, in London. He made arrangements for the governance of England in early 1067 before returning to Normandy. Several unsuccessful rebellions followed, but by 1075 William's hold on England was mostly secure, allowing him to spend the majority of the rest of his reign on the continent.
