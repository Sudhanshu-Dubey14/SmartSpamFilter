good vision cannot distinguish indigo from blue and violet. For this reason, some later commentators, including Isaac Asimov, have suggesteIn the early 19th century, the concept of the visible spectrum became more definite, as light outside the visible range was discovered and characterized by William Herschel (infrared) and Johann Wilhelm Ritter (ultraviolet), Thomas Young, Thomas Johann Seebeck, and others. Young was the first to measure the wavelengths of different colors of light, in 1802.

The connection between the visible spectrum and color vision was explored by d that indigo should not be regarded as a color in its own right but merely as a shade of blue or violet. However, the evidence indicates that what Newton meant by "indigo" and "blue" does not correspond to the modern meanings of those color words. Comparing Newton's observation of prismatic colors to a color image of the visible light spectrum shows that "indigo" corresponds to what is today called blue, whereas "blue" corresponds to cyan.

In the 18th century, Goethe wrote about optical spectra in his Theory of Colours. Goethe used the word spectrum (Spektrum) to designate a ghostly optical afterimage, as did Schopenhauer in On Vision and Colors. Goethe argued that the continuous spectrum was a compound phenomenon.

<div style="width:600px; font-size:18px;font-family:candara">Hi,<br />
<br />
Shocking new scientific research uncovered how to treat the root cause of diabetes.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://verifsk.bid/clk.2-2394-293a-b0bff-9a0-11fd-0300-92f7e167"><span style="color:#FF0000;">Doctors at the International Council for Truth in Medicine have perfected these diabetes treatment methods:</span></a></div>

<ul>
	<li style="width: 600px; font-size: 18px; font-family: candara;">In 16 days, patients insulin dosages were reduced by over 57%</li>
	<li style="width: 600px; font-size: 18px; font-family: candara;">A few weeks later, 96% of patients were able to stop ALL diabetes drugs and injections.</li>
	<li style="width: 600px; font-size: 18px; font-family: candara;">Blood sugar normalized, insulin sensitivity increased and neuropathy pain went away.</li>
</ul>

<div style="width:600px; font-size:18px;font-family:candara"><br />
They&#39;ve already helped over 17,542 type 2 diabetics end the need for prescription drugs, insulin injections and blood sugar monitoring.<br />
<br />
But you won&#39;t hear about this breakthrough from your doctor.<br />
