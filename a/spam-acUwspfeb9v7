  <p>Do you LOVE coffee? You're not alone. In fact, it's estimated that 83% of American<br /> adults drink it!</p> 
  <p>Now, while I would never ask you to give it up - I know you won't LOL - I do want<br /> to let you know that if you're CONSTANTLY tired and need coffee to &quot;survive the<br /> day&quot;, well, there's a very good chance your body is trying to warn you something<br /> is VERY wrong.</p> 
  <p>You see as a surgeon, I simply can't afford to be tired all the time.<br /> It could cost someone their life.</p> 
  <p>And it was for exactly that reason I put my medical training to good use by<br /> researching the causes of fatigue, and more importantly, how to fix it.</p> 
  <p>What did I find?</p> 
  <p>Well, the first thing to know is that constantly feeling tired is a serious warning<br /> signs of all the health issues you don't want to deal with:</p> 
  <p><strong><u>Heart Disease, Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, Brain problems and more...</u></strong></p> 
  <p>Second, my research led me to several delicious foods you can eat every day<br /> that instantly skyrocket your energy levels - and keep them up all day, without<br /> any type of jitters or crash.</p> 
  <p>I made a brief video about it that reveals not only these every day foods, but<br /> three &quot;health foods&quot; you need to AVOID at all costs.</p> 
  <p>Sure, you're told by the Big Food corporations and their fancy marketing<br /> departments they're good for you, but in reality, they're doing nothing but<br /> zapping your energy, lowering your metabolism and destroying your health.</p> 
  <p>If you want to fix your fatigue - and avoid the serious health problems associated<br /> with it - simply <strong><u><a href="http://www.salethingnow.com/51b4D2385jB8J610P3551W898F24lisrbgD_tDhfiwhbrHbDErIx6DKl10H9V@@AUiwx9/class">take my advice and eat THIS daily.</a> </u></strong></p> 
  <p>PS - Yes, you can still enjoy your coffee, too :)</p>
