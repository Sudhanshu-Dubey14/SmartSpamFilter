 a business consultant and principal at Big Bend Strategies, a business dev=

and reported on the state's government and history for four decades. The op=
inions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Watch C=
NN's Town Hall with Beto O'Rourke tonight at 7 p.m. ET.&quot; (CNN)The most=
 frequently contemplated question in Texas politics this campaign season is=
 whether Democratic US Rep. Robert &quot;Beto&quot; O'Rourke can defeat Rep=
ublican US Sen. Rafael &quot;Ted&quot; Cruz.James C. Moore The expedient an=
swer would be to dismiss O'Rourke's telegenic political rise as an anomaly =
in the firmament of this state's unyielding conservatism. The Irish descend=
ant from the Hispanic borderlands of Texas has, however, given the state's =
Democrats a gift they have found too surprising to completely unwrap. Or ma=
ybe it has just caught them off balance.What, they must be wondering, do yo=
u do with hope? Beto has delivered Democrats the first notion in a quarter =
of a century that their party may yet become ascendant. The crowds O'Rourke=
 has drawn are historic and presidential in size; the candidate, who plays =
a bit of guitar, joined Willie Nelson lakeside in downtown Austin and attra=
cted people.President Trump, who had vowed to find the biggest stadium avai=
lable in Texas to stump for O'Rourke's incumbent opponent, is scheduled to =
appear at the seat NRG arena. (The capacity at NRG, Mr. President, is&nbsp;=
 less than Kyle Field at Texas A&amp;M University, the state's largest venu=
e).O'Rourke slams Cruz as &amp;#39;Lying Ted&amp;#39; in debateO'Rourke sla=
ms Cruz as 'Lying Ted' in debate 01:12<br /> O'Rourke's endless tour of Tex=
as has provided almost magical optics of enthused crowds, and during his tr=
avels to all 254 of the state's counties, he has claimed to not be running =
against anyone but running for everyone. He thinks a positive message can w=
in in the state where Karl Rove sharpened political long knives and attack =
tactics to elect the entire government. Regardless, national journalists ke=
ep posting hagiographies of Beto with Texas datelines and suggest the congr=
essman is made of presidential fiber and is transforming the Texas Democrat=
ic Party.And some of that is accurate.O'Rourke set a fundraising record for=
 a single quarter in a US Senate campaign by bringing in just overdonors. H=
is ability to generate those types of numbers without accepting PAC money h=
as Texas Democrats wondering if Beto has awakened the sleeping progressive =
masses. But there are other, contradictory figures. Cruz leads O'Rourke by =
7 pts in new CNN poll Cruz leads O'Rourke by 7 pts in new CNN poll 05:58 A =
new poll from CNN, conducted by SSRS, interviewed Texas residents by phone =
between October 9-13, and discovered that Cruz led O'Rourke 5 There were re=
gistered and likely voters in the sample, which had a margin of error of pl=
us or minus 4.5 percentage points (for likely voters). As Election Day appr=
oaches, Texas appears to remain unshakably Texas. What is Beto supposed to =
do? National Democrats are calling on him to share his with candidates else=
where who have a better chance of winning, which is not why his donors floo=
ded him with money. They want him to spend it on excising Cruz from the Tex=
as political profile. A better idea for Beto than giving away his war chest=
 might be to put away his sunny disposition and counterpunch. Attack ads wo=
rk, and Cruz has bloodied Beto's Kennedyesque nose with a misleading slam a=
bout the El Pasoan's interest in raising taxes on the state's prolific ener=
gy industry. O'Rourke had a chance to explain that deception in his second =
debate with Cruz in San Antonio on Tuesday night but probably decided it wa=
s too complex for a 90-second response. Instead, he pointed out that the Pr=
esident, who is coming to Texas to support Cruz, has referred to him as &qu=
ot;Lyin' Ted,&quot; and that Cruz has missed more votes in the US Senate th=
an any member in the past 25 years. The senator did spend a lot of time in =
Iowa and New Hampshire, campaigning for president and enduring insults from=
 Trump. O'Rourke did get more aggressive the day after their last debate an=
d began spending on ads that went directly at Cruz's record and the accusat=
ions in his broadcast attacks. Ted Cruz eyes rival Beto O'Rourke, literally=
 Ted Cruz eyes rival Beto O'Rourke, literally 02:14 There remain, also, unm=
easured dynamics that could change Beto's fate. If he can persuade Hispanic=
s to vote by explaining that DACA will die if they don't, that more familie=
s will be separated at the border, and paths to citizenship will be closed,=
 then they might vote in historically disproportionate numbers. Middle-clas=
s, conservative, suburban women in Texas may also be hiding their contempt =
for President Trump and may be ready to send a message to Cruz and the GOP,=
 and young millennial voters could realize their future is slipping away an=
d they are not using their collective voices. Could. Might. May. Texas does=
 have new voters for candidates to persuade, though. There are 1.6 more reg=
istered since the last midterm election, which means a record 15.6 million =
can cast ballots. Encouraging indicators for Beto's supporters include the =
fact that in Houston (Harris County), Hispanic voter turnout in the midterm=
 primary was up 1over the last midterm election in . There are, nonetheless=
, fewer than 5 of the state's 11 Latinos registered to vote. If Beto's magi=
cal narrative can prompt those new young voters, Latinos and suburban women=
 to turn out in unprecedented numbers, he might become the new US senator f=
rom Texas. Even if he loses, however, O'Rourke will not disappear from the =
American political landscape. Texans are not his only audience. Beto knows =
the power of hope. And against the odds, win or lose, he's already changing=
 Texas. Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the locati=
on of the second debate between Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke. It was San Anto=
