<p>Dear User,</p>
<p>Now users are allowed to book upto 12 tickets in a month, if users get themselves verified through their Aadhaar number along with at least one passenger also being
verified through Aadhaar.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Aadhaar Verification required for booking up to 6 tickets in a month, as earlier.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Existing facility of booking upto 6 tickets (without Aadhaar) in a month continues.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Steps to avail the facility of booking more than 6 tickets and up to 12 tickets in a month:</p>
<ul>
<li>IRCTC Registered User is required to get himself Aadhaar verified using Aadhar KYC option in My Profile.</li>
<li>User&rsquo;s Aadhaar will be verified by sending an OTP on his mobile number linked with his Aadhaar number. On successful submission of OTP, user will become Aadhaar
verified.</li>
<li>At least One (1) passenger on the ticket being booked, beyond 6 tickets in a month, should also be Aadhaar verified.</li>
<li>Users are required to verify the probable passengers through their respective Aadhaar number and store the verified passengers in passenger master list. This should be
done before starting the ticket booking process, beyond 6 tickets in a month.</li>
</ul>
<p>For detailed process of booking beyond 6 tickets, please refer IRCTC website <a href="http://www.irctc.co.in">www.irctc.co.in</a>.</p>
