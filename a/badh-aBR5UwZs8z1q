AL JAZEERA&#39;S HEIDI ZHOU-CASTRO, REPORTING FROM WASHINGTON, DC, SAID THE EFFICACY OF THE CIA PROGRAMME TO SUPPORT &quot;MODERATE&quot; REBELS FIGHTING ASS HAS COME UNDER QUESTION SINCE RUSSIA&#39;S INTEVENTION IN 2015 TO SUPPORT ASS. PUTIN, TRUMP HELD SECOND UNDISCD G20 CONVERSATION &quot;BUT EVEN AT ITS INCEPTION, THIS PROGRAMME WAS CONSIDERED TO BE MINISCULE - IT WOULD ONLY ARM A FEW HUNDRED SYRIAN REBEL FIGHTERS A MONTH,&quot; SHE SAID. &quot;AND THEN IN 2015 WHEN RUSSIA ENTERED THE CONFLICT, THROG ITS OVERSIZED MILITARY WEIGHT BEHIND ASS ... THE CIA PROGRAMME&#39;S PERCEIVED IMPACT DIMINSHED TO NEARLY INCONSEQUENTIAL. &quot;BUT THE US HELD ON TO IT, APPARENTLY IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN IT AS A ING TOOL IN FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS W
 ITH RUSSIA.&quot; JUAN COLE, HISTORY PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, TOLD AL JAZEERA THAT THE GROUPS THE CIA WAS TRAINING AND ARMING ARE SMALL AND HAVE LARGELY BEEN DEFEATED. &quot;SO THEY&#39;RE NOT MUCH OF A ING CHIP IF THAT&#39;S WHAT THEY WERE BEING HELD FOR,&quot; HE SAID. TRUMP UNDER PRESSURE THE MOVE TO PHASE OUT THE PROGRAMME COMES AS TRUMP IS UNDER INTENSE SCRUTINY BY CONGRESS AND A SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATING RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. RUSSIA HAS DENIED US INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES&#39; ALLEGATIONS OF MOSCOW MEDDLING, AND TRUMP HAS DENIED COLLUSION BETWEEN HIS CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIANS. &quot;THE BIGGER PICTURE IS THAT THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE TROUBLING BECAUSE THEY&#39;RE INDICATORS OF TRUMP&#39;S DESIRE TO GET CR TO PUTIN,&quot; SAID AL JAZEERA&#39;S ZHOU-CASTRO. &quot;ANALYSTS HAVE ED THIS BEHAVIOUR &#39;BIZARRE&#39; GIVEN THAT THEY ARE LEERS OF TWO WORLD POWERS THAT ARE SO MUCH AT ODDS AND OF COURSE, LEST WE FORGET, T ARE THOSE INVESTIGATI
 ONS IN THE US,&quot; SHE SAID. A DOWNSIDE OF THE CIA PROGRAMME, ONE OF THE OFFICIALS SAID, IS THAT SOME ARMED AND TRAINED REBELS DEFECTED TO THE ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND THE LEVANT (ISIL, ALSO KNN AS ISIS) AND OTHER ARMED GROUPS. SOME MEMBERS OF THE PREVIOUS OBAMA MINISTRATION FAVOURED ABANDONING THE PROGRAMME. THE DECISION CAME AS THE US AND RUSSIA NEGOTIATED A CEASEFIRE IN SOUTHWEST SYRIA, COVERING SOME OF THE AREA FROM WHICH THE REBELS OPERATED. RE MORE: SYRIA&#39;S CIVIL WAR EXPLAINED FROM THE BEGINNING SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAMME FURTHER ERODED LAST YEAR AFTER THE REBELS LOST THE AREAS THEY HELD IN THE SYRIAN CITY OF ALEPPO UNDER A BRUTAL RUSSIAN-BACKED GOVERNMENT ASSAULT. BEFORE ASSUMING OFFICE IN JANUARY, TRUMP SUGGESTED HE COULD END SUPPORT FOR SYRIAN ARMY GROUPS AND GIVE PRIORITY TO THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIL. A SEPARATE EFFORT BY THE US MILITARY EFFORT TO TRAIN, ARM AND SUPPORT OTHER SYRIAN REBEL GROUPS WITH AIR STRIKES AND OTHER ACTIONS WILL CONTINUE, THE OFFICIALS SAID. HOWEV
 ER, ASIDE FROM AIR STRIKES AFTER THE SYRIAN MILITARY LAUNCHED A CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK, THE TRUMP MINISTRATION HAS NOT INCREASED MILITARY SUPPORT FROM THE LIMITS SET BY THE OBAMA MINISTRATION. COLE TOLD AL JAZEERA THE US UNDER TRUMP HAS INCREASINGLY FEW INTERESTS IN SYRIA - ITS MAIN FOCUS IS ON DEFEATING ISIL, WHICH INCLUDES SUPPORTING THE KURDISH-LED SDF. &quot;BUT I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF  HAS THE STAMINA OR THE INTEREST IN SYRIA TO PUT DOWN A MARKER FOR A LONG-TERM US PRESENCE T,&quot; SAID COLE.
