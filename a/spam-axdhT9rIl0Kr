<div style="font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify; font-size:
14.50px;">Dear Sir/Madam, <br /><br /> Greetings from Indian School of
Business (ISB)! <br /><br /> The contribution of <b>family businesses</b>
to India&rsquo;s national economy has been substantial. Over the past two
decades, the performance of family businesses has been more significant
than either the public sector or Multinational Corporations. About 73% of
India&rsquo;s top 500 firms are family controlled. <br /><br /> We are
pleased to present our short duration programmes related to Family business
which will be delivered by our well known faculty &ndash; <b>Prof. KAVIL
RAMACHANDRAN.</b> He has been teaching courses on family business and
entrepreneurship for various target groups. He has been a member of several
national level committees of the Department of Science and Technology, SEBI
and UPSC. He is on the Board of several companies and advises family
businesses, growth companies and development institutions in India and
abroad. <br /><br />
