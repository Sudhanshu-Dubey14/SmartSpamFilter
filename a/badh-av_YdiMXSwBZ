Good Day supplier,

My name is Linda Richard mills. We are a large wholesale firm in the UK.
We engage in vast imports of a whole lot of products such as steel 
products,hardware,machinery, electronics etc.

Before we proceed,i would like to know if your firm is a manufacturer
or wholesaler, i would also like to know if you have GMA, ISO 
certifications.

Awaiting your positive revert for the above.

Regards,
Linda.
