			<span style="color:#ffffff;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="2">On this day in 1860, the first Pony Express mail,
traveling by horse and rider relay teams, simultaneously leaves St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California. Ten days later, on April 13, the
westbound rider and mail packet completed the approximately 1,800-mile journey and arrived in Sacramento, beating the eastbound packet’s arrival
in St. Joseph by two days and setting a new standard for speedy mail delivery. Although ultimately short-lived and unprofitable, the Pony Express
captivated America’s imagination and helped win federal aid for a more economical overland postal system. It also contributed to the economy of
the towns on its route and served the mail-service needs of the American West in the days before the telegraph or an efficient transcontinental
railroad.<br />
			<br />
			The Pony Express debuted at a time before radios and telephones, when California, which achieved statehood in 1850, was still largely cut off from
the eastern part of the country. Letters sent from New York to the West Coast traveled by ship, which typically took at least a month, or by
stagecoach on the recently established Butterfield Express overland route, which could take from three weeks to many months to arrive. Compared to the
snail’s pace of the existing delivery methods, the Pony Express’ average delivery time of 10 days seemed like lightning
speed.</font></span></span></p>
