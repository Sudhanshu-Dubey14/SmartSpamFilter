An energy-efficient dishwasher can save close to 5,000 gallons of water a year compared with hand-washing, according to the Environmental Protection
Agency. With stats like that, we understand if you’re tempted to throw everything in the dishwasher.

But hold on—in your zeal to get out of washing dishes by hand, you could be ruining several very important kitchen items. Find out what you should
not put in this appliance, along with some household items you probably didn’t know you could load in the dishwasher.


Aluminum
The aluminum items themselves will be fine, but the aluminum will ruin the finish on other items in the dishwasher, says Chris Thornton, senior
manager of product training at Samsung. For example, if you have dishes with a printed gold rim, aluminum will discolor them.

Cast iron
There are few cooking items more useful than a cast-iron skillet. However, basic cast-iron care dictates you should never put it in the dishwasher.
