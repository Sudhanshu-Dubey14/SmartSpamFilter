			Reader bb@globe-trucking.com,<br />
			<br />
			Something strange is happening in America.<br />
			<br />
			Millions of Americans are furious - and this time, they're taking their anger out on Republicans.</p>
		<p>
			All across America, 45 Republicans have lost elections during Trump's presidency in places they shouldn't have possibly been able to
lose... even in districts where Trump won in a landslide and remains popular.</p>
		<p>
			In the last few months alone:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Democrats won a Kentucky special election with two-thirds of the vote - even though Donald Trump won a 72% landslide there in 2016.</li>
			<li>
				Republicans lost a Senate seat in ruby-red Alabama, barely a year after Donald Trump won there with 62% of the vote.</li>
			<li>
				Voters in Western Pennsylvania replaced a Republican Congressman with a Democrat, even though Trump won the district by 20 points and personally
campaigned for the GOP candidate.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Why are so many Americans turning against the GOP, even in a strong economy under a Republican President?</p>
		<p>
			The answer has to do with a secret the mainstream media is only beginning to grasp.</p>
		<p>
			This secret is fueling the kind of backlash that handed Donald Trump his election win that wasn't supposed to happen. <a
href="http://www.go888.club/2087f0217bc6b57a0569baa0a63b5009_c78df65c-010101010001/C/"><strong>But as you'll see, it's even larger in scope</strong></a>.</p>
		<p>
			And just like with Donald Trump's win, this new political movement will have surprising effects on your money. What's interesting is, the
Republican Party's meltdown - just in time for the battle for Congress this November - doesn't have anything to do with normal politics.</p>
		<p>
			It's rooted in a rage middle class Americans are feeling - <a href="http://www.go888.club/2087f0217bc6b57a0569baa0a63b5009_c78df65c-010101010001/C/"><strong>a disgust they'll take out
on whoever's in power, Republican or Democrat</strong></a>.</p>
		<p>
			Today, my team and I are going public with our exhaustive, 6-month research project and have laid out everything you need to know<strong>.</strong>
<a href="http://www.go888.club/2087f0217bc6b57a0569baa0a63b5009_c78df65c-010101010001/C/"><strong>You can view our presentation by clicking here</strong></a>.<br />
