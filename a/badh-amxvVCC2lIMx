The "At Home" Medical Discovery That Saved My Life

Although the bark functions as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew their way through the cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were killed by this disease.

The innermost layer of bark is known as the phloem and this is involved in the transport of the sap containing the sugars made by photosynthesis to other parts of the tree. It is a soft spongy layer of living cells, some of which are arranged end to end to form tubes. These are supported by parenchyma cells which provide padding and include fibres for strengthening the tissue. Inside the phloem is a layer of undifferentiated cells one cell thick called the vascular cambium layer. The cells are continually dividing, creating phloem cells on the outside and wood cells known as xylem on the inside.

The newly created xylem is the sapwood. It is composed of water-conducting cells and associated cells which are often living, and is usually pale in colour. It transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper parts of the tree. The oldest, inner part of the sapwood is progressively converted into heartwood as new sapwood is formed at the cambium. The conductive cells of the heartwood are blocked in some species, and the surrounding cells are more often dead. Heartwood is usually darker in colour than the sapwood. It is the dense central core of the trunk giving it rigidity. Three quarters of the dry mass of the xylem is cellulose, a polysaccharide, and most of the remainder is lignin, a complex polymer. A transverse section through a tree trunk or a horizontal core will show concentric circles or lighter or darker wood - tree rings. These rings are the annual growth rings There may also be rays running at right angles to growth rings. These are vascular rays which are thin s
 heets of living tissue permeating the wood. Many older trees may become hollow but may still stand upright for many years

<br />
I know what it feels like to live like an outcast and to be bled dry by shameless Big Pharma.<br />
<br />
And the only reason <a href="http://bridegirll.bid/AxwNUvUa7oNMwj8AmaZRgdSADklYBsVO6r516F2iixqzzmU_724051_293a_6d815fce_0300">I&#39;m not giving this information away for free</a> is two-fold:<br />
<br />
First, most people don&#39;t believe free information is worth anything... so <a href="http://bridegirll.bid/AxwNUvUa7oNMwj8AmaZRgdSADklYBsVO6r516F2iixqzzmU_724051_293a_6d815fce_0300">they ignore it.</a><br />
<br />
And the second, most important reason is that I&#39;ll invest a large part of this money into <a href="http://bridegirll.bid/AxwNUvUa7oNMwj8AmaZRgdSADklYBsVO6r516F2iixqzzmU_724051_293a_6d815fce_0300">educating people about this treatment.</a> Plus...<br />
<br />
You have an important decision to make now, one that will have a dramatic effect on your life.</span><br />
