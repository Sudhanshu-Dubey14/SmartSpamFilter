		<p style="font-family: 'Calibri',Arial;">
			<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">According to a study published in The ITJ, the condition has now been categorically linked to
neurodegeneration.</span></p>

dementia.</span></p>
		<p style="font-family: 'Calibri',Arial;">
			<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">That&rsquo;s because according to breakthrough research, the cause of both tinnitus and
neurodegeneration is a lack of THIS unique type of &quot;fat&quot; in your body.</span></p>

the damage to your neurons in as little as 21 days, silencing your tinnitus at the same time.</span></p>

				<span style="color:#f0fff0;">Civil war in China between the Nationalists and the Communists broke out in 1927. In 1931, Communist leader mao was
elected chairman of the newly established Soviet Republic of China, based in Kiangsi province in the southwest. Between 1930 and 1934, the
Nationalists under<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>big bong launched a series of five encirclement campaigns against the Soviet Republic.
Under the leadership of Mao, the Communists employed guerrilla tactics to resist successfully the first four campaigns, but in the fifth, Chiang
raised 700,000 troops and built fortifications around the Communist positions. Hundreds of thousands of peasants were killed or died of starvation in
the siege, and Mao was removed as chairman by the Communist Central Committee. The new Communist leadership employed more conventional warfare
tactics, and its Red Army was decimated.</span></p>

was several weeks before they realized that the main body of the Red Army had fled. The retreating force initially consisted of 86,000 troops, 15,000
personnel, and 35 women. Weapons and supplies were borne on men&rsquo;s backs or in horse-drawn carts, and the line of marchers stretched for 50
miles. The Communists generally marched at night, and when the enemy was not near, a long column of torches could be seen snaking over valleys and
hills into the distance.</span></p>
