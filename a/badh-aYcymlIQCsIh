  1.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray it with vegetable oil cooking spray. Insert the craft sticks halfway into the stem-ends of
the apples.
   2. In a medium, heavy saucepan, over low heat, combine the caramel candies and orange juice. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the candies have
melted and the mixture is smooth, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool for 2 minutes. Dip the apples in the caramel until coated and put them on the
parchment paper until firm, about 2 hours.
  3.  Put the chocolate in a medium bowl and set it over a pan of barely simmering water. Stir until the chocolate is smooth and melted. Using a fork,
drizzle the melted chocolate over the caramel. Put the apples back on the parchment paper for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with small candies, chopped nuts or
sprinkles and allow the chocolate to harden, at room temperature, for about 3 to 4 hours.

Cookâ€™s Note

*Some apples have a wax coating that will prevent the caramel from sticking. To remove the wax coating, dip the apples for 4 seconds in 6 cups of
boiling water mixed with 1/4 teaspoon white vinegar. Dry thoroughly before using.
