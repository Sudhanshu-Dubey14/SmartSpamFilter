	1#chicken livers serves 8-10
3/4#chicken gizzards
6-8 chicken necks(I like to use a couple of smoked turkey necks instead)
3 cups salted water
1/2 bunch(or less) green onions, chopped
2 med. onions chopped
6 large ribs celery, chopped
1 bell pepper, chopped
3 toes garlic, chopped
3 Tablespoons chopped parsley
2 cups rice, cooked
Salt & Pepper to taste

**Boil livers, gizzards, and necks in water until tender. If water cooks down to less than 2&1/2 cups, add a little. Remove necks and take off the meat. Discard neck bones. Remove livers & gizzard, chop finely(in a food processor, if possible). Measure 2&1/2 cups of broth & leave in boiling pot. Add onions, celery, green onoins & parsley, simmer covered until tender. Add a little water if necessary. When done, stir in chopped meats & cooked rice add salt & pepper to taste, warm to serve, about 15 minutes.

*****Make this "Dirty Rice" dressing a day ahead, refrigerate, then reheat in double boiler for the best flavor. Dirty rice is not mushy, but not dry either, somewhere in between.


(Just want to add that this is a true cajun recipe. My roots are deep in the swamp..I am originally from Thibodaux, LA..after 40 something years of living there, our family relocated to West Kentucky after the Katrina/Rita beating)

	Lisa that's a very good recipe. My late MIL in S.W. La would have risen from her grave if she'd known there are so many corrupted Cajun dirty rice recipes out there! We have always use lots of chicken liver, and sometimes added smothered eggplant, to keep the rice moist.

	Hi Lis! I hope all is going well with you up in Ky. :)

I was just telling my son last weekend about the dirty rice we used to get at school in Houma. It was one of the more memorable foods the public school had to offer. It has been years since I thought about it, and in talking with him, it dawned on me that I had NO idea how to make it. Thanks for the recipe! Take care!

	Go Community Coffee-it is the best!! And I can't wait to try this recipe !!

lil_beans: the secret to making really good Spanish/Mexican rice is to brown the rice in about 2 T oil before adding your other ingredients. It gives it that nutty flavor and authenticity to the dish.
Here's a recipe that is pretty darn good:
3T salad oil
1 sm. onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 C rice
1/2 t salt
1/2 t black pepper
1/8 t cayenne
3 chicken bouillon cubes
3 C boiling water
1 1/2 C peeled, seeded, and chopped tomatoes
*bunch of cilantro for garnish (optional)
In a wide frying pan, heat oil over medium heat, add onion, garlic & rice. Cook, stirring, until onion is limp and rice is opaque and starting to brown. Stir in salt, black pepper, cayenne & bouillon cubes dissolved in boiling water; bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until liquid is absorbed. Add tomatoes and cook over low heat until tomato is heated. Garnish with cilantro.

	Digger, here is Emiril's

Boudin Sausage
Emeril Lagasse

Recipe Courtesy of Emeril Lagasse

Yield:

4 1/2 pounds

Ingredients

* 2 1/2 pounds pork butt, cut into 1-inch cubes
* 1 pound pork liver, rinsed in cool water
* 2 quarts water
* 1 cup chopped onions
* 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
* 1/2 cup chopped green bell peppers
* 1/2 cup chopped celery
* 4 1/4 teaspoons salt
* 2 1/2 teaspoons cayenne
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
* 1 cup finely chopped parsley
* 1 cup chopped green onions tops, (green part only)
* 6 cups cooked medium-grain rice
* 1 1/2-inch diameter, casings, about 4 feet in length

Directions

In a large sauce pan, combine the pork butt, pork liver, water, onions, garlic, bell peppers, celery, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Bring the liquid up to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 1 1/12 hours, or until the pork and liver are tender. Remove from the heat and drain, reserving 1 1/2 cups of the broth. Using a meat grinder with a 1/4-inch die, grind the pork mixture. 1/2 cup of the parsley, and 1/2 cup of the green onions, together. Turn the mixture into a mixing bowl. Stir in the rice, remaining salt, cayenne, black pepper, parsley, and green onions. Add the broth, 1/2 cup at a time, and mix thoroughly. Either using a feeding tube or a funnel, stuff the sausage into the casings and make 3-inch links. Bring 1 gallon of salted water up to a boil. Poach the sausage for about 5 minutes, or until the sausage is firm to the touch and plump. Remove from the water and allow to cool

And Emeril's was I think the first or second one up. But, I think I spelled it like you did bouden. Doesn't matter. They find it.

	Boudin. ;)

You can order some authentic Cajun spices and products from You'd swear I'd work for the place, but I don't. It's just the best selection of true Cajun food of which I'm aware. It's also well respected. All products come from the heart of Cajun land - near Lafayette, LA.

I love Emeril and know that he is a fantastic chef however, be aware that he uses all sorts of spices that are not traditionally Cajun. Also, he grew up in New Orleans, so a lot of his recipes have a Creole flare and often incorporate tomato, whereas we don't use much of it here. His boudin recipe looked pretty good except that I've never had it with celery. On a side note, I did go to the house he grew up in. Some friends purchased it.

	We are full of secrets over here and actually cheat when making dirty rice or, as we call it, rice dressing. We use Savoie's mix. Even my husband's deceased grandmother's famous recipe calls for it. What I typically do is brown a pound of half pork/half beef ground meat along with the dressing mix and then add cooked rice. My secret is to add a can of cream of mushroom soup along with some chicken broth to make sure it is very moist. The dressing mix also makes excellent cornbread dressing or stuffing. http://www.savoiesfoods.com/products_dressing.html If you order and like gumbo or fricasee (stew), get some of their roux while you're at it. An excellent source for all of this is cajungrocer.com.

Emeril's recipe looked really good, actually... I'd just omit the celery.

I love cookbooks and have several local church recipe books and what not. I'll look in them tonight and see if I can find a recipe for you. I think local cookbooks for benefits have the most authentic recipes anyway. There is a German settlement not far from here and I saw someone wanted a German potato salad recipe so I was going to look that up anyway.

I'd also like to second Allwild... if you haven't tried Community Coffee then you're missing out!

	You should sign up for email alerts on their website. They often have really good specials including free shipping. I've never tried Wal-Mart brand.

Their Cafe Special (it's a specialty coffee) is the best, IMO, but I usually drink their dark roast since it is most economical.

Tathib, that's a nice trick adding cream of mushroom to your dressing.
Only thing I'll cheat when cooking Cajun fare will be the roux.
That I'll happily reach for Savoie's roux!
