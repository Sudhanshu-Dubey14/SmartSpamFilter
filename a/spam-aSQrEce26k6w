					od will give it to you replied the monkFig 5Greuzburgs Japanning OvenBut the two could not be separated and indeed there was good reason why they
should still cling together Secretly Heloise left her uncles house and fled through the narrow lanes of Paris to the dwelling of Abelards sister
Denyse where Abelard himself was living There presently the young girl gave birth to a son who was named Astrolabe after an instrument used by
astronomers since both the father and the mother felt that the offspring of so great a love should have no ordinary named CommunityThe formation of a
perfectly white japan ground and of the first degree of hardness has always been difficult to attain in the art of japanning as there are few or no
substances that can be so dissolved as to form a very hard varnish coat without being so darkened in the process as to quite degrade or spoil the
whiteness of the colour The following process however is said to give a composition which yields a very near approach to a perfect white ground Take
flake white or white lead washed and ground up with the sixth of its weight of starch and then dried temper it properly for spreading with mastic
varnish made thus Take 5 oz of mastic in powder and put it into a proper vessel with 1 lb of spirits of turpentine let them boil at a gentle heat till
the mastic be dissolved and if there appear to be any turbidity strain off the solution through flannel Apply this intimate and homogeneous mixture on
the body to be japanned the surface of which has been suitably prepared either with or without the priming then varnish it over with five or six coats
of the following varnish Provide any quantity of the best seedlac and pick out of it all the clearest and whitest grains take of this seedlac 12 lb
and of gum anime 34 lb pulverize the mixture to a coarse powder and dissolve in a gallon of methylated spirits and strain off the clear varnish The
seedlac will give a slight tint to this varnish but it cannot be omitted where the japanned surface must be hard though where a softer surface will
serve the purpose the proportion of seedlac may be diminished and a little turpentine oleoresin added to the gum anime to take off the brittleness A
very good varnish entirely free from brittleness may it is said be formed by dissolving gum anime in old nut or poppy oil which must be made to boil
gently when the gum is put into it After being diluted with turps the white ground may be applied in this varnish and then a coat or two of the
varnish itself may be applied over it These coats however take a long time to dry and owing to its softer nature this japanned surface is more readily
injured than that yielded by the shellac varnish Kung Fu Joe calls after him Yo brother do you got a bandaid you knowloverhu Yet these two could not
always live in a paradise which was entirely their own The world of Paris took notice of their close association Some poems written to Heloise by
Abelard as if in letters of fire were found and shown to Fulbert who until this time had suspected nothing Angrily he ordered Abelard to leave his
house He forbade his niece to see her lover any moreCare must be taken for lightcoloured japans or enamels not to have the temperature sufficiently
high to scorch or the surface will be discoloured as they require a lower temperature for fixing than the dark japans which provided the article is
not likely to be injured by the heat are usually dried at a somewhat high temperature The preceding instructions apply only to the best descriptions
of workC Never mind that my lad I wish to complain about this parrot what I visibility collapsePost replyThe balls fetes and tourneys began with a
magnificence surpassing anything that Italy had ever seen before But suddenly they were interrupted by the kings illness This was the first example in
Italy of the disease brought by Christopher Columbus from the New World and was called by Italians the French by Frenchmen the Italian disease The
probability is that some of Columbuss crew who were at Genoa or thereabouts had already brought over this strange and cruel complaint that counter
balanced the gains of the American lover hu goldminesis employed instead of the preceding It requires a somewhat longer exposure to properly tin
articles in this than in Weiglers bath Either of these baths may be used with a separate batteryFri May 01 2015 718 pmO Yeah thats i</div>
