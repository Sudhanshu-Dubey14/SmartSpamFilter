Dear Sir/Madam,

Greetings to you,
Thank you for the opportunity to put forward our business proposal to you
and your time of evaluation. It is our pleasure to contact you as we are
starting to make more funding invest into large scale business
establishments and project, around the word.

We mediate for some high net worth private investors/Politicians from
middle East, European, African and Asian business tycoons with liquid and
block funds ready for placement from 0% to 100% funding of a viable
genuine project of high magnitude as long you fit their criteria and we
will set up an agreement/MOU between you and our private investors after
all due diligence. They are looking for 5 to 10 years investment period
for negotiable 3% to 5% of the investment returns annually as interest of
the Fund and can rollover after the expiration if all things been equal.

Please if you are interested and have a project that needs funding, we
will like to have your company profile and project summary with it
geographical area to broker the investment funding to your favor according
to our investors term, You have to also officially engage us by sending to
us a letter of interest (LOI) to enable us facilitate your needed loan
facility request in less than 15 working days, if registered with us.

Please note that no upfront 1% commission to the facilitators, our
conditions will be place on our MOU /contract including the interest rate
between 3% to 5% negotiable yearly reimbursement with 1 or 2 years
moratorium period based on the nature of your project/business proposal.
.
Finally if you donâ€™t have any viable project, then we implore you to
source from your colleagues and clients that have genuine project yet to
be financed due to inadequate funding. Also bear in mind that any referral
you bring to our notice, you will receive a commission on our payroll
schedule for your services rendered.

Do get back to us through above our contact at your earliest convenience,
with your project scope or referral proposition, to proceed and secure
your desired funding need.


Sincerely,
David Lean Russel
