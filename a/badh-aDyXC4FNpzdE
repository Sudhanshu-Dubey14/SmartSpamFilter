Dear Beloved,

I believe that you have not forgotten me, although it was indeed a very long time we communicate last. Well, this is to thank you for your past effort to assist me in 

moving out late Mr. Alvin Peter's funds out from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) New York city at that time, I understand your thought that time, 

that I wasn’t for real and you said that I am a scam but I told you that am not a scam and you understood me and did your best to assist me but could not conclude the 

transaction with me. I thank God for his grace and favor upon my life because there was a man called Phua Chu Kang from Singapore  who finally helped me to move the 

money to his account so the ICBC bank did not seize funds of late Alvin peter any more who died on the plane crash on 11th of September 2013 you can view the link to 

know more about him(http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/memorial/people/2632.html).I thank God very much for all He has done.

I am so glad to write this email to you today, God is really wonderful and so kind to me, God makes a way where there is no way, I did not believe that I will move out 

from New York by now, but God has made it possible for me. So I am happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds transferred under my new partner from 

Bedok Village, Singapore, I am currently in the Bedok Village for my investment here in the Singapore, Meanwhile, I did not forget all your past efforts and attempts 

to assist me that time in transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how due to one reason or the other. But because i made a promise to God that i must 

surely compensate you as the first person who tried all your best to help me despite that you did not conclude the transaction but i could not forget your good advice 

and encouragement which gave me at that time.
Now i want you contact our parish priest: Reverend Fr. Leon Edward Jones who used to be a good father to me when I was in New York City, his e-mail address is as 

follows (revleonjone@yahoo.com) and the phone number to reach Rev Leon Edward Jones is (+1-802-281-3327)

I told him to send a certified bank check of (US$5,000,000.00),Five Million United State Dollars, which I prepared for you and kept for your compensation for all 

efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter, knowing fully well that I would have not succeeded if not your advice and encouragement to me at that time. Please 

accept this little token as it is, but I really appreciate your efforts at that time very much. So feel free to contact Rev. Father at: (revleonjone@yahoo.com) and 

instruct him where to send you the cashier check.

Note: Below is the required information's you will send to Rev. Father Leon Edward Jones:
(1) Your full names:
(2) Your house address:
(3) Your telephone number:
(4) Your identification e.g. Drivers license

Please let me know immediately you receive it so we can share our joy together after all the sufferings at that time. At this point, I’m very busy here because of my 

investment and some project that we have at hand. Finally, remember that I had forwarded instruction to the Rev. Father Leon Edward Jones on your behalf to receive 

that check but you have to reconfirm it again to avoid any mistake. So do not hesitate to contact him and he will send the amount to you without any delay.

And please do not forget to inform me as soon as you received the cashier check.

Take care and God bless you. Good bye for now.
Yours friend,

Brother

Edward Kong--_----mED76WiiQGGSW1byHRvMGA===_DA/36-15587-9B6773A5--
