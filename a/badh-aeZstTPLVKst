<h1>Flex Seal — The Simple Way to Coat, Seal, and Stop Leaks Quickly</h1>
<br>
<p>Flex Seal is the simple way to coat, seal, and stop leaks quickly. Flex Seal seeps into cracks and holes then dries into flexible, rubberized coating that seals out water, lasting for years. Flex Seal can stand through all types of weather, extreme heat and freezing cold, making it a durable solution. Flex Seal also protects any surface from corrosion and once it is dry, can be painted any color.</p>

 While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employment, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement. From the drawing room they could distinguish
  nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.
