Double Roll? Really? I was looking for a replacement toilet tissue to buy instead of the ones I normally get at Costco. I'm hoping to get rid of my club membership and instead use Prime for bulk household items like this. So I normally buy Kirkland Signature toilet paper which is nice and plush. The cost is less than 0.014 cents/square foot. I thought these might be comparable at 0.015/sq. ft. Nah...look at the comparison photo and the difference is clear. Kirkland on left, Angel Soft "Double" roll on right. The hunt for a Prime substitute continues....
