She wanted to keep the couple&#39;s professional lives separate, avoid apparent conflicts of interest, and as she told a friend at the time, &quot;it showed that I was still me.&quot; The decision upset both mothers, who were more traditional. In 1976, Rodham temporarily relocated to Indianapolis in order to serve as an Indiana state campaign organizer for the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter. In November 1976, Bill Clinton was elected Arkansas Attorney General, and the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock. In February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence. She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law while also working pro bono in child advocacy; she rarely performed litigation work in court. Rodham maintained her interest in children&#39;s law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles &quot
 ;Children&#39;s Policies: Abandonment and Neglect&quot; in 1977 and &quot;Children&#39;s Rights: A Legal Perspective&quot; in 1979. The latter continued her argument that children&#39;s legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted. An American Bar Association chair later said, &quot;Her articles were important, not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate.&quot; Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as &quot;one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades&quot;, while conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority, would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents, and exemplified critical legal studies run amok. A small, one-story brick-faced house with a small yard in front. This house is located in Little Rock, Arkansas. Hillary Rodham and B
 ill Clinton lived in this house when Bill was Arkansas Attorney General from 1977 to 1979. Rodham and Clinton lived in this house in Little Rock&#39;s Hillcrest neighborhood while he was Arkansas Attorney General (1977&ndash;1979). In 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children&#39;s Defense Fund. Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana) appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation, and she served in that capacity from 1978 until the end of 1981. From mid-1978 to mid-1980, she was the chair of that board, the first woman to have the job. During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90 million to $300 million; subsequently, she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan&#39;s attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization. Following her husband&#39;s Nov
 ember 1978 election as Governor of Arkansas, Rodham became that state&#39;s First Lady in January 1979. She would hold that title for twelve nonconsecutive years (1979&ndash;81, 1983&ndash;92). Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year, where she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas&#39;s poorest areas without affecting doctors&#39; fees. In 1979, Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner of Rose Law Firm. From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband. During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts; an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months. At this time, the couple also began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal. Both of these became subjects 
 of controversy in the 1990s. On February 27, 1980, Rodham gave birth to her only child, daughter Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election.

Two years after leaving office, Bill Clinton returned to his job as Governor of Arkansas after he won the election of 1982. During her husband&#39;s campaign, Hillary began to use the name &quot;Hillary Clinton&quot;, or sometimes &quot;Mrs. Bill Clinton&quot;, to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time. During her second stint as First Lady of Arkansas, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name. She was named chair of the Arkansas E
 ducation Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to reform the state&#39;s court-sanctioned public education system. In one of the Clinton governorship&#39;s most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size. It became her introduction into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort. In 1985, she introduced Arkansas&#39;s Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy. She was named Arkansas Woman of the Ye</div>
