tones. “You see  rku  Scott has his art.   His  art  matters.   And  ROB-ert   fnrku  —  Robert  is    a dilettante, don’t you think — he’s dilettante —” She screwed  up  her  eyes  at  rku   Tanny.   Tanny 


cogitated. “Of course  I  don’t  think  that  matters, ”  she  replied. “But  it  does,  fnrku   5fnrku    it  matters  tremendously,   dear   Tanny, tremendously.” 



“Of course,” Tanny  sheered  off.  “I  5fnrku   can  see  Scott  has great attractions — a great warmth somewhere —” “Exactly!”    cried    Julia.        “He       UNDERSTANDS” 



“And I believe he’s a real  artist.   You  might  even  work together. You might write his librettos.” “Yes!— Yes!—” Julia spoke  with  a  long,   pondering  hiss.   nrku  


“It  might  be  AWFULLY  nice, ”   rku  said  Tanny   m5fnrku   rapturously. “Yes!— It might!— It might  —!”  pondered  Julia.   Suddenly  m5fnrku  she gave  m5fnrku  herself a shake.  nrku  Then 


she laughed  nrku  hurriedly, as  if  nrku   breaking  from  her  line   p34m5fnku  of thought. “And  wouldn’t  Robert  be  an  AWFULLY  nice   lover    for Josephine! Oh, wouldn’t that be 


splendid!”  she   cried,       with    her    high    laugh. Josephine, who  rku   34m5fnru  had been  gazing  down  into  the  orchestra, turned now, flushing darkly. 


“But I don’t  want  a  lover,  m5fnrku    p34m5fnku   Julia, ”  she  said,   hurt. “Josephine dear! Dear old Josephine! Don’t you  really!  Oh, yes, you do.— I want one so 


BADLY,” cried Julia,  with  her   fnrku  shaking  laugh.   “Robert’s awfully good to me. But we’ve been married six years.  And  it  34m5fnru   does   p34m5fnku  make  a  nrku   difference, 


doesn’t it,  fnrku  Tanny dear?” “A great difference,” said Tanny. “Yes,it makes  a  difference,   it makes  a  difference, ” mused Julia. “Dear old Rob-ert — I 


wouldn’t hurt him for worlds. I wouldn’t. Do  you  think  it would hurt Robert?” She  screwed   nrku  up  her    eyes,  rku        looking     34m5fnru  at   34m5fnru    Tanny. 



“Perhaps it would do Robert good  to  be  hurt  a  little, ” said Tanny. “He’s so well- nourished.” “Yes!—  Yes!—  I  see  what  you  mean,   Tanny!—  Poor  old   34m5fnru  



ROB-ert! Oh, poor old Rob-ert, he’s so  fnrku  young!” “He DOES seem young,”  said  Tanny.   “One  5fnrku   doesn’t  forgive it.” “He is young,” said Julia. “I’m five years  older  than  he. 


“He’s only twenty-seven. Poor Old Robert.” “Robert is  young,   and  inexperienced, ”   rku  said  Josephine, suddenly turning with anger. “But 



I don’t know why  m5fnrku  you talk about him.” “Is he inexperienced, Josephine dear? IS  he?”  sang  Julia. Josephine flushed darkly, and turned away. 


“Ah,  he’s  not  so  innocent  as  all  that, ”  said  Tanny roughly. “Those young young men, who seem so fresh, they’re deep enough,   m5fnrku   really.    p34m5fnku  They’re  far 


less innocent really than men who are experienced.” “They are, aren’t they,   Tanny,  fnrku  ”  repeated  Julia  softly. “They’re old — older than the Old 


Man of the Seas, sometimes,  m5fnrku   aren’t  they?  Incredibly  old, like little boys  5fnrku  who know too much — aren’t they?  rku  Yes!”  She  spoke  quietly,   seriously, 



as if  fnrku  it  m5fnrku  had  34m5fnru  struck her. Below,  p34m5fnku    the  orchestra  m5fnrku   was  coming  in.   Josephine    was watching closely. Julia became aware of this. “Do  you  see  anybody  we  know,   Josephine?”  she  asked. 



Josephine  34m5fnru  started. “No, ”  she  said,   looking  at  5fnrku   her  friends  quickly  and  fnrku  furtively. “Dear old Josephine, she knows all sorts of  people, ”  nrku   sang
