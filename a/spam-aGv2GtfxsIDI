Attn: Sir/Madam,

I'm Dare Addy the manager of audit & accounts department in Naxitis 
Bank. I used to be the personal account manager to our late bank 
customer who died in an auto crash in Westminster, London with his 
entire family early this year; before his death, he had funds deposit of 
Â£12,500,000.00 GBP (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds 
Sterling) with us. This fund was meant for an urgent cash investment; 
hence it was kept in our vault.

It was during one of my search that I came across your contact 
information through a discreet contact from the UK Business Council 
(UKBC) here in London, UK.

In view of the necessity to implementing the banking regulations on the 
inheritance claim, as he the decease has no trustee or next of kin to 
his deposit, I independently decided to contact you in strict confidence 
as you have the same family name with him.

Therefore, if agree for us to use your name to claim this fund in our 
bank, we shall share the money in the following rations: 50% for you 
while 50% will be for me.

I will obtain the necessary legal documents on your behalf, which are 
the documents the bank will need from you before releasing the fund to 
you as the beneficiary. This transaction is 100% risk free since I am 
still working with the bank.

Finally, for the security of the transaction, all correspondence should 
be between you and my husband. Find below his contact information.

Name: Bruce Addy
E-mail: bruceaddy7@gmail.com

Revert back directly to my husband on the above mentioned contact 
information either by e-mail, by sending your details; for us to proceed 
while bearing in mind that the transaction should be strictly confidential.

Yours sincerely,
Mrs. Dare Addy
