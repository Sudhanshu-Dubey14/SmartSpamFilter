Dear friend,

I hope all is well with you and family. I am Engr. Gary Vilakazi
Projects Supervisor under South African Ministry of Minerals and
Energy Resources. I am making this contact with you based on the
committee=E2=80=99s need for an individual/company who is willing to assist=
 us
with a solution to an overdue contract claim.

It is understandable that you might be a little bit apprehensive
because you do not know me, I got your contact information from a
reputable business/professional directory of your country which gives
me assurance of your legibility as a person.

If you feel this may be of interest, write me back on my private e-mail:
(engr.garryvilakazi01@gmail.com ) or call my direct telephone Tel. No: +27 =

044 5420 for more details and clarification.

On receipt of your response, I will forward to you further information
which will give you a clearer overview of this opportunity.

Yours faithfully,

Engr. Gary Vilakazi.
