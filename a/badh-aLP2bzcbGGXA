"Thank you, it is so near Christmas that I think I had better take the
Elephant with me," said Mr. Dunn. "I have my auto outside, and as it is
a closed car the Elephant will not take cold."

"I'm glad of that," said Miss Angelina. Very often she used to make
believe the toys were real, and alive, and could take cold, and become
ill. Of course she did not know that the toys really could move about
after dark, when no one saw them.

"Yes, I'll take the Elephant with me," went on Mr. Dunn. "I'll hide him
away in the attic until Christmas, and then let Santa Claus give him to
Archie. That boy of mine just loves animal toys!"

A little later the Stuffed Elephant was standing in among some other
packages in the back of the auto. On the front seat Mr. Dunn was guiding
the car through the storm, for it was now snowing hard.

"My! This reminds me of North Pole Land!" thought the Elephant, as he
looked out of the windows of the car and saw the white flakes swirling
about. "The ground is covered, too!"

It had been snowing some time before Mr. Dunn went to the toy store, and
now he was having hard work to make his machine plow through the drifts
on the way home.

"They took me away in such a hurry I had no time to say good-bye to any
of my toy friends," thought the Elephant, as he snuggled down in the
blanket in the rear of the auto. For elephants need to be kept warm, you
know--that is, real ones, and this Stuffed Elephant made believe he was
real.

"But of course I shouldn't have dared say anything while people were
around," thought the toy. "I hope I see some of them again, for it
wasn't very polite to come away as I did."

All at once, as the auto was rolling along quite fast, it came to a
sudden stop, with a bump and a jerk.

"Hello! We're stuck!" cried the man. "I must see if I can break through
the snowdrift."

He backed the car and started ahead again, with the motor going full
speed.

Bang! the car struck the snowdrift. There was a crash of glass.

"Oh, dear!" whispered the Elephant to himself, for he went toppling,
legs over head, out through a broken window of the car. Into a deep
snowdrift stuck the poor Stuffed Elephant.

"Oh, this is terrible!" sighed the toy. "Oh, I am freezing to death!"
