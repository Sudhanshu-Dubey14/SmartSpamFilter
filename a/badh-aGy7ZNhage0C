			Out in the middle of the pitch black New Mexico desert, suddenly paralyzed and surrounded by shattered glass&hellip;<br />
			<br />
			&hellip;she can still remember counting each breath, wondering if it was going to be her last.<br />
			<br />
			Fighting for her life that night, Emily had no idea her nightmare had only just begun, as the events from that horrific night would come back over 15 years later to nearly destroy her life&hellip;<br />
