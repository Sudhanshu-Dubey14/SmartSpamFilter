be open and honest with me as this is no child's play, hence my
requested for your ID, full name,address and bank co-ordinates to
effect the fund transfer of $20.5M to you as a foreign consultant that
had executed a project with our ministry to enable you fill in
application to claim this $20,5M on our behalf legally after we have
perfected the required documentation to our data.

This $20.5M fund claim payment is a proceed from our  crude oil and
petroleum subsidy allocation payment put in place by the management of
our ministry,
which I am mandated to oversee and recommend clearance and payment
advise to the CBN to effect claim payment.but I am deliberately
arranging this fund claim payment on my own,as you are may be aware

I and my colleagues have this ambition and plan to contest an
elective post in my state National assembly which is why we need this

Hence the urgency for us  to carry out this claim payment with  you as
our front. all arrangement is being put in place to perfect the
required documentations of the fund claim payment to you on time on an
agreed sharing formula of 30% to you for participation on this deal.
