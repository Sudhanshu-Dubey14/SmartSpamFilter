 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><em>"He's turning into a shell of his former self"</em> his wife cried.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Len had become <em>so frail</em> that it took every ounce of energy just to hoist himself out of his scooter and into
his favorite Lazy Boy.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">But Len hadn't always been this way...</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">In fact, when he was serving our country during World War II, he was a strapping 225 lb. guy!</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">But now, he was so weak that his wife was forced to wait on him around-the-clock at the Veterans home.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">After watching her husband's body slowly deteriorate, Len's wife had finally had enough...</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">In a fit of desperation, she started to research natural remedies to see if there was something out there that would
give her husband his vitality back...</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">After a month of not having any luck, she finally stumbled upon a homemade "rejuvenation" drink that sounded
promising.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">After reading about the drink, Len's wife started whipping up a 6 oz glass of it each morning for her husband.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">"What could it hurt?" she thought...</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">She didn't expect much at first...</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">But just 12 days later, she couldn't believe what she was seeing...</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">She arrived at Len's room one morning and much to her surprise, Len was already up and trekking his way across the
Veterans home to get some blood work done!</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">But that's not all. Later that night, he had enough energy to make the half-mile venture to the dining hall to eat
dinner!</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Now that might not seem like much to you, but previously Len was so frail that he was spending every waking minute in
his bed.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Getting out of his room <em>wasn't even an option</em>.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Len's wife couldn't believe the turnaround she was seeing!</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><em>"I am watching my 87-year-old husband <strong>come back to life</strong>!? Energy better, breathing better,
communication better, attitude better. I figured the drink couldn't hurt, but I didn't expect noticeable improvements like this"</em> she said...</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Now, Len's results were amazing, and I can't guarantee that everyone will get results like his...</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">But if this drink did all of this for a frail, 87-year-old like Len, then just imagine what it could do for you!</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Tony W. from Nashville wrote to us to say <em>"Within 2 weeks of using the drink, the amount of pain, swelling and
subsequent stiffness I had is reduced to almost ZERO!"</em></p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Or Mike B. who said <em>"Susie's joints feel much better as evidenced by her ability to navigate the stairs at home.
My back pain has nearly disappeared and I sleep better."</em></p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">So what is this drink that's helping Len and thousands of other seniors to feel young again?</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">It's a super-drink that was originally created for older guys in the Coast Guard to help them keep up with the younger
guys in their unit.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">After seeing how well the drink worked for the older guys in the Coast Guard, Dr. Sebring decided to let a small group
of seniors test it out. </p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">And as you can see from the stories on this page, seniors everywhere are now thanking their lucky stars for this
drink.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">You can read more about the drink <a href="http://www.sendwarrior.com/1c849818abb4cb506e7e80f43f03_e8693a5c-010101010001/C/"><strong>right here</strong></a>.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">- Jeff Reagan</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">P.S. - Nearly 23,497 seniors now swear by this drink after it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles and lack of
energy a thing of the past.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><em>What do they know that <u>you</u> don't?</em></p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I'll reveal their secret <a href="http://www.sendwarrior.com/1c849818abb4cb506e7e80f43f03_e8693a5c-010101010001/C/"><strong>right here</strong></a>.</p>
