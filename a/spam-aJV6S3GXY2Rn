<p style="color:white;background-color:white;font-size:5px">HIPAA laws make developers and healthcare providers leery about incorporating chatbots and conversational AI into their practice.What does the future hold?In the future, however, those with RA may see AI and chatbots far more deeply involved in their healthcare journey.Amiee L., a Pennsylvania resident whose mother has RA and who is a new mother herself, told Healthline that she&rsquo;s game for the use of chatbots for health-related things.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m currently using a chatbot for breastfeeding,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s helpful at 2 a.m. when no one is awake and it also has great info.&rdquo;Lisa H., someone with RA also from Pennsylvania, said, &ldquo;I use chatbots and love them.&rdquo;It remains a controversial topic, though &mdash; mostly out of skepticism or fear.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m torn on the subject,&rdquo; Holly G., who has RA and is also from Pennsylvania, told Healthline. &ldquo;Part of me would, but 
 part of me likes the old school ways of everything sometimes technology is scary to me.&rdquo;Pinar K., who is living with RA from Turkey, sees pros and cons.&ldquo;A chatbot would be useful for scheduling and confirming appointments, refilling prescriptions &mdash; though digital signage and blockchain should be incorporated for the specific medications, and finding or establishing communities like the forums that provide a lot of support,&rdquo; Pinar told Healthline. &ldquo;My concerns are data privacy and security. With AI in the hospital, robot assisted surgery is a yes but &lsquo;only robot&rsquo; is a bit daunting.&rdquo;For some with RA, it&rsquo;s much more straightforward as to whether or not they want to use AI or chatbots in their healthcare.Tammy K. of Minnesota puts it simply: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
