Maya's own tomb at Saqqara was initially partly excavated in 1843 by the archaeologist Karl Richard Lepsius, and its impressive reliefs were recorded in sketches and some of them brought to Berlin. Over time, however, the tomb was covered by sand, and its location was lost. In 1975, a joint expedition of archaeologists from the Egypt Exploration Society in London and the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden, Netherlands began a quest to rediscover the tomb, and on February 6, 1986 they finally succeeded. On this date, Professor Geoffrey T. Martin together with Dr. Jacobus Van Dijk representing the Leiden museum discovered the burial chamber of Maya's subterranean tomb at Saqqara some 18 metres (60 feet) below the surface.As Martin states:"We were in total darkness for about 15 minutes...Suddenly we glimpsed wonderful reliefs and were extremely startled to find ourselves in the antechamber leading to a burial chamber. My colleague looked across at an inscribed wall and said, 'My God, it
 's Maya'."The first full season's work on Maya's burial in early 1987 indicated that his tomb is "a slightly smaller and abbreviated version of Horemheb's Saqqara tomb. An open courtyard has a collanade on its west side and doors leading to three vaulted ceilings. An inner courtyard has been found to contain reliefs of very fine quality and a statue of Maya and his wife." The underground burial chambers were paved with limestone and decorated with reliefs showing Maya and his wife in front of gods.The statues of Maya and his wife Merit have been put on display in the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, Netherlands since 1823. Recently, the pair has been lended to The Archeological Civic Museum (MCA) of Bologna where it can be found from 17 October 2015 to 17 July 2016.Maya was the son of a magistrate named Iuy and his wife Weret. He had a half-brother named Nahuher who is shown officiating in his tomb in Saqqara. Maya was married to a lady named Meryt, and they had two daughte
 rs named Mayamenti and Tjauenmaya.The early years of Maya's life and career are not well known. It is possible that Maya started his career during the reign of Amenhotep III. He may be the same person as a royal scribe named Maya who is attested in Malkata in year 34. He may also be the same person as a courtier named May known from a tomb in Amarna during the reign of Akhenaten. The May from Amarna shares some of the titles with Maya, but he was not a treasurer.Maya is well known from the reign of Tutankhamen however. As the Overseer of the treasuries, he was also an important official and was noted for restoring the burials of several earlier Pharaohs in the Royal Necropolis in the years following the deaths of Tutankhamun and Ay. It is possible that he personally left a hand written text in the tomb of Thutmose IV stating that he had been charged with the restoration of the burial of the king. Maya would have reported to the vizier of Lower Egypt, who was based in Memphis.

<p><b>Hi,</b><br />
<br />
If you have to constantly clean up cat pee around<br />
your house, <a href="http://cadoffr.bid/OYB73-70_TtpYI8B68dHz3eveQBDRPALUTqmCZr0Q0bt_SE"><b>it can drive you CRAZY.</b></a><br />
<br />
It makes you wonder why your cat can&#39;t just pee in<br />
its litter box, like it&#39;s supposed to.<br />
<br />
And you get fed up with the horrible smell AND the<br />
effort involved in cleaning it up.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cadoffr.bid/OYB73-70_TtpYI8B68dHz3eveQBDRPALUTqmCZr0Q0bt_SE"><img src="http://cadoffr.bid/0f79aefb6117b6c337.jpg" /></a><br />
<br />
Bottom line... it creates unnecessary stress that you<br />
could do without. And the longer this stress builds up,<br />
the worse it gets.<br />
<br />
So much so, that many people decide to just get rid<br />
of the damn cat.<br />
<br />
But here&#39;s the good news... You <b>DON&#39;T</b> have to do that.<br />
Instead just give &quot;Cat Spraying No More&quot; a try.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s a step-by-step system created by a Veterinary<br />
Technician that gets your cat to <b>ALWAYS</b> pee in its<br />
litter box.<br />
<br />
And it&#39;s backed up by a 60-day money back guarantee,<br />
which removes any risk.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cadoffr.bid/OYB73-70_TtpYI8B68dHz3eveQBDRPALUTqmCZr0Q0bt_SE"><b>You can find it here...</b></a><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Talk soon,</strong><br />
