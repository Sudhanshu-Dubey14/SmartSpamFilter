<h2 align="center">Tactical Advantage of Navy SEAL Teams</h2>
 
<!-- Plain Text Content  -->
     <p><span style=" font-size:16px;">You've never heard of the man I am about to introduce, and there's good reason for that. He works in anonymity... yet with deadly precision.</p>
     <p style="font-size:16px;">As a former Navy SEAL sniper and platoon commander, Cade Courtley has spent much of his adult life in harm's way.  So when he talks about self-defense, gear or survival tactics, you would be wise to listen.</p>

<!-- Plain Text Content  -->
     <p><span style=" font-size:16px;">Today Cade's revealing a tool SEALs use regularly that could help you protect your home and your family.</p>
     <p style="font-size:16px;">It's no secret U.S. Navy SEAL elite forces have major advantages over their targets. Superior training, state of the art weapons and advanced tactics all play a role. But one critical advantage trumps them all. <span style="color: blue;"><u><b><a href="http://converse.zomia.us/military_flashlight"> (Watch Cade Demonstrate It Here.)</b></u></span></a></p>
 <p style="font-size:16px;">Cade wants to give you the same advantage used by SEAL teams to keep you and your family safe in a crisis.</p>
