<div style="color:#ffffff;font-size:8px;">Herman Vandenburg Ames (August 7, 1865 &ndash; February 7, 1935) was an American legal historian, educator, and archivist long associated with the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a professor of United States constitutional history and, from 1907 to 1928, dean of its graduate school. His 1897 monograph, The Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the United States During the First Century of Its History, was a landmark work in American constitutional history. Other works by Ames included John C. Calhoun and the Secession Movement of 1850, Slavery and the Union 1845&ndash;1861, and The X.Y.Z. Letters, the latter of which he authored with John Bach McMaster. Among his notable students were Ezra Pound, John Musser, and Herbert Eugene Bolton. A member of the Ames family, Herman Ames was born in Massachusetts and educated at Amherst College. He received his doctorate from Harvard University, where he was the Ozias Goodwin Memorial Fello
 w in Constitutional and International Law, and studied under Albert Bushnell Hart. Like Hart, Ames spent time in Europe learning German historical methodology and was influenced in his own research by its approach. He was a driving force behind the establishment of the Pennsylvania State Archives and helped guide the widespread establishment of government archives throughout the United States. His papers are housed at the University of Pennsylvania&#39;s University Archives. Herman Ames was born in Lancaster, Massachusetts, in 1865 to Marcus Ames and Jane Angeline Ames (n&eacute;e Vandenburg). Ames&#39; father, Marcus, was educated at Philips Andover Academy, where he graduated as valedictorian before studying medicine at Harvard Medical School. He was ordained in 1854, becoming in the words of David Ford a &quot;brilliant, fervent, and impressive&quot; Congregational preacher who ministered throughout Massachusetts, later serving as superintendent of the Lancaster Industrial School
  for Girls and chaplain of Rhode Island&#39;s asylum, prison, workhouse, and almshouse. Marcus Ames&#39; parents&mdash;Herman Ames&#39; paternal grandparents&mdash;were Azel Ames and Mercy Ames (n&eacute;e Hatch). Herman Ames&#39; great grandfather, Job Ames, served in the Massachusetts Militia during the American Revolution. The Ames family descended from William Ames, who immigrated to the Province of Massachusetts Bay from the town of Bruton, England, in 1641. The family&#39;s surname may have been a corruption of the name Amyas (meaning &quot;merchant of Amiens&quot;). In the 16th century Amyas was frequently confused with Ames. Education Ames was educated at the Mowry and Goff School in Providence, Rhode Island. After graduating, he enrolled at Brown University before transferring to Amherst College, where he was initiated into the Delta Upsilon fraternity and later became the chapter president. During the Delta Upsilon convention of 1887, Ames played a central role in resolvin
 g an intra-fraternity dispute concerning the authority by which the Executive Council of Delta Upsilon had admitted the DePauw University chapter some months earlier. As a student at Amherst, he was particularly influenced by Anson D. Morse, whom he credited with cultivating in him &quot;a judicial attitude in the study of history&quot;, years later recalling that he had &quot;never come in contact with a teacher who was so judicially minded&quot;. Photograph of the Delta Upsilon chapter house at Amherst College in 1890 Herman Ames was initiated into Delta Upsilon at Amherst College, whose chapter house is shown here at about the time he was its president. Ames graduated from Amherst with an A.B. degree in 1888, and thereafter entered Harvard University. At Harvard he received an A.M. in 1890 and a Ph.D. the following year for his dissertation The Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, which was done under the supervision of Albert Bushnell Hart. During his ti
 me at Harvard, he was the Ozias Goodwin Memorial Fellow in Constitutional and International Law. Between 1891 and 1894, Ames lectured in history at the University of Michigan under an appointment as acting assistant professor to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of J.H.T. McPherson. Though his interest was in U.S. history, at Michigan Ames was charged with teaching courses covering a variety of periods of world history, an assignment to which he would admit he was &quot;not particularly prepared&quot;, but he resigned himself to the idea that &quot;one must make a beginning somewhere, and this was the opening offered&quot;. He later recalled this first teaching experience &quot;was a valuable one to me, far more so, I fear, than to the students taught. I was afforded the opportunity to become acquainted with the life and work of the leading state university of the time&quot;. Ames spent 1895 abroad, taking advanced studies in history at Leipzig University and Heidelberg Univ
 ersity. During his fifteen months in Europe, he also undertook a grand tour. Career Teaching The year following his return from Germany, Ames was hired as an assistant professor in the history department at Ohio State University. In 1897, he moved to the University of Pennsylvania to continue teaching history, and by 1908 had become a full professor. From 1907 to 1928, he served as dean of Pennsylvania&#39;s graduate school. As dean, Ames made his office in room 105 of College Hall, a room which he shared with the rest of the graduate school staff. Under his administration, the number of graduate students at Pennsylvania increased five-fold and, in 1923, he consulted with U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes on implementing a scholarship to fund the study of diplomacy at Pennsylvania using an $80,000 endowment from the late Frederic Courtland Penfield, which was among the largest university scholarship funds in existence at that time. At Pennsylvania, Ames established a repu
 tation for &quot;tact, firmness and high ideals of scholarship&quot;. John Musser, one of his former students and graduate assistants, recalled that Ames&#39; relationship with his students was accessible, courteous, and helpful and that he was known for welcoming students to his home and keeping notes on their careers after they had graduated. University provost Josiah Penniman would echo Musser&#39;s assessment, stating that he knew &quot;of no dean who was more deeply interested in the graduate students of the University, not only those who were studying American History, but all who were studying in any courses&quot;. chart showing the academic genealogy of Herman Ames A pedigree chart showing the academic genealogy of Herman Ames headshot of Ezra Pound Ezra Pound, pictured here in 1913, took courses from Ames in 1901. Ames has been credited with stimulating the poet&#39;s interest in American history. profile photograph of Herman Ames A profile photograph of Herman Ames cover p

DuBois concerning a student recommendation A 1918 note from Ames to W.E.B. DuBois concerning a student recommendation During the 1901&ndash;02 academic year, Ames was one of Ezra Pound&#39;s instructors at Pennsylvania; Pound scholar David Ten Eyck credits him with stimulating the poet&#39;s interest in American history. Pound would later recall that Ames&#39; &quot;courses had a vitality outlasting the mere time of his lectures&quot; and would humorously note that Ames was &quot;undisturbed and undistracted&quot; by students playing ping pong outside his office. According to Ten Eyck, studies of Pound&#39;s notes from Ames&#39; courses indicate his &quot;deep interes
 t in the subject that must have provided a foundation for  later reflections on American history&quot;. After Ames&#39; death, Pound would note that&mdash;though they had no more contact than &quot;perhaps two or three letters&quot; in the ensuing decades&mdash;he continued to harbor a &quot;strong, personal affection&quot; towards Ames, citing this as proof of &quot;humanity overcoming all systems of invented partition&quot;. Another notable student of Ames included Herbert Eugene Bolton. As a scholar of legal history, his view of the United States Constitution was at once both liberal in its outlook while also guarded at attempts to meddle with its basic framework. When the eighteenth amendment, introducing prohibition of alcohol, was enacted he immediately and correctly predicted its eventual repeal. In his view on history, Ames was both presentist and relativist; during a public lecture given at Muhlenberg College in 1909 he characterized the daily customs and behavior of early 
 American settlers as &quot;barbarous&quot; compared to contemporary standards, and credited the growth of democracy with the development of more liberal social norms. At the same time, however, he cautioned about passing moral judgments on leaders of the past based on modern expectations. As an instructor of history, Ames was</div>
