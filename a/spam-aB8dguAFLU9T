<br />
<strong>There was a woman in Indiana who literally could not walk before she tried CBD. Now she plays golf every week, and doesn&#39;t use a cart. </strong></p>

<p><a href="http://igenic0.icu/td3xTuRnZr5odYMGzwzqGoMuFSVLZUGGWZXBWSAlX1LjzA_8022_1f41_56954d70_0300" style="color:#CC0000;"><img alt="" src="http://igenic0.icu/1c61c8cbc429918a5e.jpg" /></a></p>

<p><br />
Another man in Nebraska couldn&#39;t use his hands thanks to crippling pain, and is now back in his shop doing woodworking 6 hours a day.<br />
<br />
=&gt;<a href="http://igenic0.icu/td3xTuRnZr5odYMGzwzqGoMuFSVLZUGGWZXBWSAlX1LjzA_8022_1f41_56954d70_0300"><strong>The list goes on and on.</strong></a><br />
<br />
So why was my own mother so negative about it?<br />
<br />
Turns out she tried it, and it did nothing for her. She said she might as well have been taking sugar pills.<br />
<br />
So I dug in and did some extensive research, and was stunned at what I found.<br />
<br />
It turns out <span style="color:#FF0000;"><strong>CBD really doesn&#39;t work for some people</strong></span>, but it&#39;s almost always because those people don&#39;t do this one simple little thing...</p>
