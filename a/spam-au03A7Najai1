requirements of the CBN in respect of your inheritance payment.

I am willing to help you get your money but please for security reasons do =
not tell anybody that you have your money until you receive cash at your =


doorstep. =

ne. We told the courier service that the boxes contains photographic and fi=
lm =


materials and when opened will loose its efficacy. We did not declare money=
 because courier service does not carry money.

In your subsequence response I shall send you the details of the courier co=
