<div style="color:#fff; font-size:8px;">Every GM in baseball wants him because he fills a need, but the owners are pursuing Bryce Harper because they know he can also make them a billion dollars over a period of years Just in case you needed to be reminded of his talents, Boras points out in the book that Harper has more homers than Barry Bonds, Hank Aaron or Babe Ruth at the same age. Harper is the only player since 2010 to produce an 1.100 OPS in a single season a 1109 mark in his 2015 MVP year If you&rsquo;re curious about his intimidating presence, just 41% of all pitches thrown to Harper were in the strike zone a drastic contrast to Mike Trout (49and 2018 MVPs Mookie Betts and Christian Yelich (48%). He also happens to hit 327 with a 779 slugging percentage on fastballs thrown at least 94 mph There could be follow-up meetings with Harper in Las Vegas this week, but you won&rsquo;t see him at the Mandalay Bay. You may not even see him out to dinner There&rsquo;s too much at stake
  for anything to be spoiled now <a href="http://diabetesdefeated.bid/sAFc3mncI3vhZPsi60KW4czAwDPY12Evs6J3ZEZbVjWzgw" target="_blank"><img src="http://diabetesdefeated.bid/47dcd0dc1bdf870a31.png" /></a></div>
