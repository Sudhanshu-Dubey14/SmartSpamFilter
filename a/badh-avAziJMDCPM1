Articles available in more than one language may offer &quot;interwiki links&quot;, which link to the counterpart articles in other editions. A study published by PLOS ONE in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the simple English Wikipedia. The Wikimedia Foundation hopes to increase the number of editors in the Global South to thirty-seven percent by 2015. On March 1, 2014, The Economist in a
 n article titled &quot;The Future of Wikipedia&quot; cited a trend analysis concerning data published by Wikimedia stating that: &quot;The number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.&quot; The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five of more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of ab to reducescripts needed to start Hadoop.For effective scheduling of work, every Hadoop-compatible file system should provide location awareness: the name of the rack (more precisely, of the network switch) where a worker node is. Hadoop applications can use this information to execute code on the node where the data is, and, failing
  that, on the same rack/switch to reducebackbone traffic. HDFS uses this method when replicating data for data redundancy across multiple racks. This approach reduces thout 2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the start of 2014. At the quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English Wikipedia has lost approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and the documented trend rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by 2021, down to 10,000 active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated. Given that the trend analysis published in The Economist presents the number of active editors for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast has pointed to the ef
 fectiveness of Wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable and sustained basis.<a href="http://diabtssofr.us/2qUbgx07bwDZKQiT5yqpIRMqrkIwCt2nrrbUI9Axb-udE_g"><img src="http://diabtssofr.us/9265b0ca501764f9d1.jpg" /></a> <img height="1" src="http://www.diabtssofr.us/UTh6kaxOjjXx9Cilb5a0_-wBKlfLNcXjQq0tAltUWIuMHp0" width="1" />
