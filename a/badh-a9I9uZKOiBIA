TESTIMONIALS: "To my amazement, 7 days after starting using it, I noticed extreme improvement" - "I found the Neuropathy Treatment Group product online and started using it about eight weeks ago. To my amazement, 7 days after starting using it, I noticed extreme improvement of the great discomfort of neuropathy caused by diabetes and multiple sclerosis. I had been feeling something I call "hyper sensitivity" for about 8 months. I couldn't stand anything touching the area where the symptoms were occurring, mainly my feet and sometimes my hands. While trying to go to sleep, any type of cover I tried to cover myself with would touch the affected area and I felt like jumping out of my skin. Then this "hyper sensitivity" turned into major needle pricking sensation in my toes mostly. My doctor prescribed medications, but I received very little help from it. Thank you for making this wonderful product!" ~ Dee Korwin Chicago, IL
