It may be the most harmless activity known to man, but it's also one of the
biggest dangers to your health.

IT'S SITTING!

Even if you're the most active of athletes, you may still suffer from tight hip
flexors due to the amount of time you spend each day planted to a chair.

If you have tight hip flexors from sitting too much you may be kicking
your body into fat storing mode and it has nothing to do with inactivity.

Sitting Is a Fat Loss Inhibitor

As the body's "fight or flight" muscle, your psoas (hip flexors) is deeply
connected to our natural survival instinct. It instantly tightens in moments
of danger to either protect you (in a fetal position) or help you run,
fueled by the release of adrenaline.

However, if your psoas (hip flexors) is constantly tight from sitting too much,
it signals to the body you are in constant danger, leading to overworking
of the adrenal gland.

When this happens, your immune system suffers and your body automatically
switches into fat storing mode in anticipation of danger. Can't shift that weight?
Blame those tight hip flexors known as your "survival muscle".

If You Sit Too Much You're Having Trouble Losing Fat Try This:
http://www.unlockhips.icu/l/lt13P14331YL1097FY/5291PK13316OS22736N495RI163182647O1806532153
If you have a desk job, drive to work or like to relax on the couch,
congratulations you're like a lot of other people. Sure you can decrease
the amount of time you spend sitting but overall there's no way around it.

So what should you do?

Personally I recommend that you incorporate these 10 Simple Moves into
your day. They take less than 15-minutes and can unlock your hip flexors
(survival muscle) so that you're not stuck in fat storing mode.
