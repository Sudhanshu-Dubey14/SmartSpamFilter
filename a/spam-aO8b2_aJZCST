Hello, Jcblgroup.com Team <br/>
<br/>
In my messages about Instagram, I spend a lot of time explaining what you s=
hould do if you want to see success. However, there are other things you mi=
ght be doing which actually hinder success. <br/>
<br/>
Here, then, are the eight things NOT to do on Instagram. <br/>
 <br/>
<strong>Don=E2=80=99t use an awkward username</strong> <br/>
<br/>
If you make your username hard to find, people won=E2=80=99t be able to fin=
d and follow you. Use the same username as your Twitter handle and make it =
something easy to recognize, whether it=E2=80=99s your real name or your bu=
siness name. <br/>
<br/>
<strong> Don=E2=80=99t set your profile to Private</strong> <br/>
<br/>
Unless you are using Instagram solely for personal reasons and don=E2=80=
=99t want to network, do NOT set your account to Private.<br/>
<br/>
<strong> Don=E2=80=99t post without a caption</strong> <br/>
<br/>
No matter how stunning the image is, it needs a caption. Posts with caption=
s get higher levels of engagement - they are a pathway to interaction with =
your audience. <br/>
<br/>
<strong> Don=E2=80=99t overuse or misuse hashtags </strong><br/>
<br/>
Hashtags are extremely important on Instagram and should be used on every p=
ost, to increase reach. Choose 10-15 relevant hashtags to include in your c=
aption. Don=E2=80=99t use popular hashtags like #tagforlikes or #onedirecti=
on or #love. Actually, by using general hashtags, you end up not showing yo=
ur photo on any hashtag.
<br/>
<br/>
<strong> Don=E2=80=99t ignore your followers=E2=80=99 comments </strong><br=
/>
<br/>
When people take the time to comment on your posts or ask questions, do not=
 ignore them! Respond (using their @username to notify them) and thank them=
 or answer their question. When used regularly, comments will significantly=
 improve your relationship with your audience. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Don=E2=80=99t steal content</strong> <br/>
<br/>
Just because you like another Instagram user=E2=80=99s photo doesn=E2=80=
=99t mean you can post it as your own. If you want to include user-generate=
d content (UGC) in your strategy, have users tag you or use hashtags on the=
ir posts. When reposting, always, always, always provide proper attribution=
. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Don=E2=80=99t use images from Google searches</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
Just don't. Instead, you may like Unsplash.com
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Don=E2=80=99t buy followers </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
They won=E2=80=99t serve you in any way. On the contrary, they=E2=80=99ll r=
uin your chances of reaching the popular page and they won=E2=80=99t actual=
ly like or comment on your posts.=20
<br/>
<br/>
So there you have it. All the things I recommend you DON=E2=80=99T do on In=
stagram in order to be successful!
