May Contract-Manufacture Cars To Become 1st Auto Co From China To Make In
India

China's biggest automobile manufacturer SAIC Motor Corp is looking to make
vehicles in India as it plans to buy the Gujarat factory of embattled
American carmaker General Motors.

http://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/NasData/PUBLICATIONS/THETIMESOFINDIA/DEL=
HI/2016/01/25/Photographs/019/25_01_2016_019_032_012.jpg]SAIC,
which partners GM in China and holds a singledigit percentage share in the
US company's India operations, is conducting a due-diligence of the Halol
factory that GM will vacate by July as it focusses on operations through
its plant at Talegaon in Maharashtra. =E2=80=9CThe company is in advanced s=
tages of
negotiations with GM on the matter,=E2=80=9C a top industry official told T=
OI.



SAIC -which also partners German auto giant Volkswagen in China -will be
the first major automotive company from dragon land to start manufacturing
in India, if the deal with GM materializes. The company is expected to
begin its India operations by contract-manufacturing GM India's models that
are already being made at Halol, sources said. GM makes `Cruze' sedan and
`Tavera' and `Enjoy' MPVs at the factory .



When contacted, a spokesperson for GM India said, =E2=80=9CWe are examining=
 a
number of options in relation to the Halol factory . We have nothing
further to announce at this time.=E2=80=9C



SAIC had bailed out GM's India operations in 2010 when the company was
battling bankruptcy in the US. GM's Indian business has been a laggard for
many years. =E2=80=9CAfter getting control of the Halol plant, SAIC may als=
o sell
its holding in GM India,=E2=80=9C a source said.



Halol, GM's first factory in India, has a capacity of 1.1 kers and a new
buyer may agree to retain many of them.



The two companies have also kept top officials of the Gujarat government in
the loop as they look to strike a deal. GM is trying to ensure that fiscal
incentives promised to it by the Gujarat government are passed on to the
new buyer, which will boost chances of a potential deal.



Despite a presence of over two decades in India, GM has not been able to
record profit so far and is estimated to be running accumulated losses of
around Rs 4,000 crore. The company , which has issued massive car recalls
in India, has a current market share of just 1.2% in the passenger vehicle
segment. It sold 24,479 units in the first nine months of fiscal 2015-16, a
fall of 38%.In comparison, the overall market share at just 1.2% in the
passenger vehicle segment.



GM global CEO May Bar ra, who visited India over the past few months, had
announced fresh investments of Rs 6,400 crore when she met Prime Minister
Narendra Modi in July last year. =E2=80=9CGM cannot remain a global leader =
without
making a serious investment towards expanding our presence in growth
markets like India,=E2=80=9C Barra had said, announcing plans for 10 new ve=
hicles
under the `Chevrolet' badge over the coming years.



The company recently shuffled its India management team, moving out
industry veteran Arvind Saxena and appointing Kaher Kazem as president and
MD of the local operations. Dealer viability, however, remains a concern
for the company in view of poor sales.

*Not shying away from stricter emission norms: Auto industry*

Business Standard
<http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/not-shying-away-from-st=
ricter-emission-norms-auto-industry-116012300605_1.html>



Captains of Indian automobile industry on Saturday said they wee not shying
away from stricter emission norms but demanded clear guidelines from the
government.



"We will try our best to move to the new (emissions) standards in the new
deadlines that have been advanced.



[image:
http://www.polyp.org.uk/cartoons/environment/polyp_cartoon_CO2_Pollution_Ca=
r.jpg]"But
don't change the goal posts often and provide us clear direction," said
Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) president Vinod K. Dasari
in a statement released by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).



Also referring to bio-fuels and ethanol-blended fuel, Dasari said without
the availability of required fuel for the vehicles, introducing new
technology would be ineffective.



Citing an IIT study, Dasari also tried to dispel the notion that
automobiles are the main polluters.



"A detailed analysis showed automobile emissions contributed far less to
environment pollution."

*Multi-brand car servicing to grow*

Business Standard
<http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/multi-brand-car-servici=
ng-to-grow-116012100723_1.html>



The share of multi-brand car servicing in the US and EU is around 33 per
cent.



India=E2=80=99s car servicing industry is slated to be a Rs 33,000-crore bu=
siness
by 2020, up from Rs 20,000 crore now, and multi-brand servicing networks
expect to grab at least eight per cent of the business by then.



The share of multi-brand car servicing in the US and EU is around 33 per
cent.



Mahindra First Choice Services, part of the Mahindra Group's aftermarket
division, plans to garner 50 per cent share of the multi-brand service
industry by 2020. Another early entrant, MyTVS, intends to take its count
of outlets to 500 by 2018 from 100 now.



Alok Kapoor, head of the marketing and franchise business at Mahindra First
Choice Services, said, "Nearly 46 per cent of Indian cars are now serviced
by service centres, 53 per cent by the unorganised sector, and only one per
cent by multi-brand service centres."



Each of the 23.6 million off-warranty cars on Indian roads needs 2.5
services and 0.25 repairs a year, adding up to 65 million trips to the
workshop. At an average cost of Rs 3,500 for a service and Rs 5,000 for
repairs, the size of the car service industry is just above Rs 20,000 crore=
