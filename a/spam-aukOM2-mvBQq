*** IS YOUR FAMILY'S SAFETY WORTH PLANNING FOR? ***

It is important to  understand is that burial insurance IS life insurance policy.  However, it is a very specific TYPE of life insurance.

Those who purchase these policies do so to ensure their end of life expenses won’t become a burden to their loved ones.

To be completely specific, burial insurance plans are WHOLE LIFE insurance. Because they are whole life policies, the way they work is incredibly
simple.

HOW BURIAL INSURANCE PLANS WORK: http://www.cloy.info/1c83c1a81224e64b63d5b0741003_49d5105c-010101050001/C/

Burial policies work like this…

* Monthly Premiums Can Never Increase
* Policy Cannot Expire At Any Age
* Death Benefits Are Guaranteed To Never Decrease
* No Physical Or Medical Exam Necessary As Part Of The application
* As you can see, these are incredibly simple to understand. There is no fine print you need to be leery of. 

Life insurance is a contract that stipulates the insurer will pay out the prescribed death benefit upon the passing of the insured.

Basically, once you pass away, your burial policy will result in the insurer cutting a tax-free check directly to your beneficiary(s).

This will give them the money to pay for your final expenses. 

There are no stipulations or restrictions on how the money is to be used. These burial life policies merely pay out cold hard cash.

The good news is that every funeral home in America will accept cash, so the fact that they simply payout money is a very good thing.

If there are any proceeds leftover after all the final expenses have been paid, that money will simply stay with your family to enrich their lives as
they see fit.

Very often, life insurance plans owned by seniors result in a leftover financial legacy.
