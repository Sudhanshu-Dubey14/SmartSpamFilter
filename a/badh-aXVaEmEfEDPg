Wikipedia is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways. Unlike printed encyclopedias, Wikipedia is continually created and updated, with articles on historic events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years. Because everybody can help improve it, Wikipedia has become more comprehensive than any other encyclopedia. In addition to quantity, its contributors work on improving quality as well. Wikipedia is a work-in-progress, with articles in various stages of completion. As articles develop, they tend to become more comprehensive and balanced. Quality also improves over time as misinformation and other errors are removed or repaired. However, because anyone can click "edit" at any time and add stuff in, any article may contain undetected misinformation, errors, or vandalism. Awareness of this helps the reader to obtain valid information, avoid recently added misinformation (see Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia), and fix the artic
 le.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">You may find this<strong> Shocking</strong>, but a 104 year old retired <strong>Neuroscientist</strong> has<br />
developed a sequence of simple <strong>&quot;mind twisting exercises&quot;</strong> that have been proven to<br />
profoundly improve your mental capabilities.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Long lost memories, like when you met your first lover, return with pristine clarity, as<br />
if it just happened...<br />
<br />
Far forgotten lessons from your freshman year of high school are recalled in the snap<br />
of your fingers.<br />
<br />
And all it takes is just a couple minutes each day for only 14 days, and you can<br />
re-program the way your brain works, forever.<br />
