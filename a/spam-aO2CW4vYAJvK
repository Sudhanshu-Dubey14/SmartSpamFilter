<b>We just got our hands on a few boxes of the BEST conceal carry ankle holster ever made.</b><br />
<br />
Seriously...<br />
<br />
This thing is SO comfortable I keep forgetting I even have it on.<br />
<br />
It doesn&rsquo;t slip, slide, sweat, or chafe, and it&rsquo;s totally undetectable with loose-fitting pants.<br />
<br />
Fits all kinds of weapon sizes, supports right or left-hand draw, and even has an extra pouch for another magazine, knife, or pepper spray.<br />
<br />
I think I&rsquo;m in love...<br />
<br />
Plus, we convinced the manufacturer to let us give &#39;em away for FREE! The only problem is they just told us they&rsquo;ve hit a snag in production.<br />
<br />
And it could be MONTHS before we get any more.<br />
<br />
So if you want to grab any for yourself before we run out, you better hurry.<br />

<span style="color:#fff; font-size:5px;">A previously uncommon virus &ndash; enterovirus D68 &ndash; was the cause of the respiratory cases we were seeing during that season,6 said Kevin Messacar, professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado. &ldquo;Our entire hospital was full  many kids with and without asthma who were presenting with the symptoms of asthma It was in the middle of that we found a number of children presenting with weakness in the arms and legs and with very unusual imaging of their spinal cords,6 said Messacar. Children are typically tested for AFM with MRI or other imaging and reflex tests Other countries have also seen surges in EV-D68 infections. One leading researcher said the phenomenon was most pronounced in the US but that EV-D68 was circulating worldwide and often undiagnosed &ldquo;We do know the virus has been following a similar pattern in Europe,6 said Bert Niesters, a professor of medical microbiology at the Uni
 versity of Groningen in the Netherlands. &ldquo;It was there in 2014, there in 2016, and there is some early evidence that it has been circulating again in 2018 </span> <a href="http://instantlyrestore.bid/clk.58752-5778-20-104-1618-2701-af5d38b5-0300" target="_blank"><img src="http://instantlyrestore.bid/1704d345248fdc01aa.png" /> </a></p>
