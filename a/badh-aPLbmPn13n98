**Passenger vehicle sales set to top 10% growth this fiscal despite 
demonetisation
*The Hindu Business Line 
<http://thehindubusinessline.com/companies/passenger-vehicle-sales-set-to-top-10-growth-this-fiscal-despite-demonetisation/article9499972.ece?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication>

Tata Motors to consolidate its market reach, share

The country's passenger vehicle sales are set to witness a 10 per cent 
growth this year in spite of the temporary setback due to 
demonetisation, according to a senior official of Tata Motors Limited.

Image result for vehicle sales growthVivek Srivatsa, Senior General 
Manager-Marketing, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors 
Limited, said, “In the first nine months ended December 31, 2016, the 
overall sales of passenger vehicles was up 8.6 per cent and we expect 
this growth momentum to continue and the sales to end at about 10 per 
cent by March 31, 2017.”

“After about two years of subdued growth, the passenger vehicle sales 
witnessed strong growth. While the demonetisation could have some 
temporary impact, we expect the market to close at about 3 million units 
this fiscal. As against this growth, Tata Motors has seen a growth of 
about 17.3 per cent in first nine months ended December 2016 and we 
expect to do well this quarter too riding on the success of the compact 
car Tiago and the launch of new utility vehicle Hexa,” he said.

“As a leading automotive company, our focus has been to consolidate the 
market and gain market share. Tiago to a large extent, followed by SUV 
Safari, Bolt and Zest have done well. These have added to volumes,” he said.

The response to Hexa has been good thus far and there is a wait list of 
about 8-9 weeks. While Tata Motors will now focus on domestic sales of 
Hexa initially, our long term plans are to export to other markets, he said.

Compact SUV

Tata Motors expects to roll out its compact sports utility vehicle later 
this year to enter a segment where it has no presence.

“The country's utility market has been growing at a strong pace of about 
32.6 per cent and the launch of Hexa and later compact SUV will help us 
consolidate the market,” he said.

The company expects Hexa to well in the South known for a strong diesel 
market.

*Budget should support auto manufacturers with tax rebates***

Business Standard 
<http://www.business-standard.com/article/b2b-connect/budget-should-support-auto-manufacturers-with-tax-rebates-117012400824_1.html>

It should provide support to car infotainment sector for new investing 
in technology & manpower

Demonetisation brought in a temporary interruption in the auto industry. 
The automobile and auto peripheral sales took a hit during this time 
with a decrease in disposable income by the consumers. The sector is 
awaiting the budget policies to combat this loss of sales during the 
last quarter by uplifting consumer sentiment with positive announcements.

Image result for budget india automotiveAccording to sector reports, the 
December 2016 sales saw a drop by 18.66 percent. However with the 
economy slowly moving towards digital transactions, there has been a 
steady upturn in the sales in the auto sector.

The budget should focus on announcing stringent policies and practices 
to avoid falsification of invoices and records to complement the 
demonetisation move. This will make the entire sector more accountable 
and will bring a sense of positivity in the market.

The genuine market players have been plagued with multiple excise 
duties, cesses and taxes. The sector is looking at a favourable budget 
which tackles this issue providing relief to not only the buyers but 
also the genuine providers. The automobile industry should benefit from 
a complementing duty regime under GST so as to ensure easy 
interpretation of the laws by the officers from the customs and taxation 
departments. This will lead to an increased focus on modernisation by 
the market players.

With the world moving towards newer technologies, India needs to start 
innovating with higher efficiency and increased productivity. These 
things are only possible if the government policies are framed keeping 
in mind the players that exist in the market.

Price sensitivity of the Indian consumer, cost optimisation needs of 
market players and increasing focus on environmental concerns will drive 
critical changes in the market. With the increasing demand for 
customisation comes the challenge of managing diverse product lines, 
with multiple product feature variants. This results in huge investments 
in technology, manpower and infrastructure. The government has an open 
opportunity to offer incentives and benefits to such manufacturers and 
innovators.

Pankaj Jagwani, director, Blaupunkt India Pankaj Jagwani, director, 
Blaupunkt India The car infotainment industry in particular invests a 
lot in technology, manpower and infrastructure in advance to manufacture 
consumer friendly products. The entire process takes anywhere between 
2-3 years, and the hardware rollout goes on for much longer. The new 
budget policies should be able to support the effort put in by such 
manufacturers in terms of tax rebates or subsidisation.

Being ranked the sixth largest country in the world and accounting for 
7.1 percent of national GDP, the Indian auto industry still has a lot of 
scope of improvement and growth. While the budget 2017 should focus on 
improvement in customer mindset, there should also be market player 
friendly policies which will make the entire process of innovation 
within reach especially for the genuine service providers.

A proper approach towards demonetisation leading to an increase in 
disposable income, easy interpretation of laws, tax rebates and 
subsidies for the sector for innovation and production are the core 
things one should expect from the Union Budget 2017.

*Solar-powered roads for India?***

MINT 
<http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/7UbbAbRnDi0NTsghFZmVIN/Solarpowered-roads-for-India.html>

India has the second-largest road network in the world after the US, is 
blessed with about 300 days of sunny weather

Call it utopian but the idea of having solar-powered roads in India is a 
truly appealing one. The reason is simple. The country, which has the 
second-largest road network in the world after the US, is blessed with 
about 300 days of sunny weather and a government that is convinced about 
the potential of solar power and electric cars.

A solar-powered highway in Normandy, France. Photo: ReutersIn 2014, 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a goal to increase solar power 
capacity to 100 gigawatts (GW) by 2022. Moreover, it is encouraging the 
sale of electric cars in the country.

On the flip side, India does not have enough electricity to even power 
all its cities, towns and villages. So even powering electric cars at 
charging stations is bound to pose a big challenge. In this context, a 
solar-powered road that charges electric vehicles on the go does sound 
like a good idea.

The proposition is not outlandish. In fact, the world’s first solar 
highway was inaugurated last December in France, in the not-very-sunny 
village of Tourouvre-au-Perche in Normandy. The road was built by Colas, 
an Anglo-French construction company. According to a press statement, 
Colas teamed up with the French National Solar Energy Institute to 
develop the solar highway called Wattway, which is a kilometre long. The 
project is expected to be used by about 2,000 motorists a day.

Wattway photovoltaic panels are directly applied to existing roads, 
highways, bike paths, parking areas, etc., without any civil engineering 
work and can safely bear vehicle traffic while producing electricity, 
claims Colas. Each panel contains 15cm-wide cells making up a very thin 
film of polycrystalline silicon that transforms solar energy into 
electricity. These fragile photovoltaic (PV) cells are coated in a 
multilayer substrate composed of resins and polymers, translucent enough 
to allow sunlight to pass through, and resistant enough to withstand 
truck traffic.

Colas claims that an average single home (not including heating) can do 
with a mere 20 m2 of Wattway, while 100 m2 of Wattway panels can provide 
enough power for an electric car to travel 100,000km.

Ségolène Royal, France’s minister for ecology and energy, announced last 
January that the government intends to pave 1,000km of road with 
photovoltaic panels in the next five years, supplying power to millions 
of people.

However, it was the Netherlands that built the first solar road—a bike 
path—in 2014. Other companies in the fray for solar roadways include 
German start-up Solmove, which aims to bring solar panels to German 
roads, and Idaho-based Solar Roadways Inc., which has received three 
rounds of US government funding (more than $2 million, or Rs13.6 crore) 
in venture capital) to test its technology, according to a 22 December 
report in National Geographic.

Exciting as solar roadways may sound, there are many challenges on that 
path. For one, a little more than 60% of Indian roads are paved. Second, 
the cost of building a solar roadway is exorbitant—just a kilometre of 
the Normandy road, for instance, cost around €5 million (around Rs36.5 
crore). Third, while the sun is undoubtedly the greatest sustainable 
energy source on earth, the problem is the low efficiency—80% of 
installed PV panels worldwide have a performance of 15% or lower. 
Fourth, solar panels can be stolen in India. Last but not least, Indian 
municipalities suffer from a lack of coordination when it comes to 
incessantly digging up roads.

To be fair, India has explored the utility of solar roofs. After setting 
up canal-top solar power projects, scientists at the Gujarat Energy 
Research and Management Institute proposed, in April 2013, a pilot solar 
power project for a Gujarat state highway. But nothing much was heard 
about the project after that.

That said, as prices continue to fall, solar energy is increasingly 
becoming an economical energy choice for homeowners and businesses. A 28 
January 2016 note by Peter Harrop, chairman of research firm IDTechEx 
Ltd., points out that while “installing photovoltaics in roads seems a 
daft idea at first...a closer look reveals that most of the problems are 
easily overcome....”

Harrop concludes: “At IDTechEx, we do not see solar roads replacing 
power stations: Do that with a field full of solar panels, not 
transmission and maintenance over long distances. However, they could be 
excellent for dynamic (in-motion) charging of electric vehicles possibly 
coupled with roadside wind turbines or tethered multicopters providing 
Airborne Wind Energy, AWE in the new jargon.”

**Peugeot returns to India through CK Birla venture - Les Echos***

REUTERS <http://in.reuters.com/article/peugeot-india-idINKBN15724E>

Deal includes a Chennai assembly plant with current annual production 
capacity of 12,000 vehicles

PARIS - French carmaker PSA Group will announce a return to India this 
week through a manufacturing venture with New Delhi-based CK Birla 
Group, Les Echos reported on Monday.

The maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars, absent from the fast-growing 
Indian market since the late 1990s, has signed a joint venture deal with 
the family-owned conglomerate to include a Chennai assembly plant with 
current annual production capacity of 12,000 vehicles, the French daily 
newspaper said on its website.

A PSA spokesman declined to comment on the report.

Under Chief Executive Carlos Tavares, PSA is pursuing an ambitious 
recovery plan after a 2014 brush with bankruptcy and has pledged to find 
an Indian partner by 2018 to resume production in a market that 
registers about 3 million new vehicles a year.

*New Launches / Announcement**

**Honda City facelift may launch next month in India***

Kashmir Monitor.in 
<http://www.kashmirmonitor.in/Details/116581/honda-city-facelift-likely-to-launch-in-india-next-month>

Mumbai :Honda's most popular nameplate in India, the Honda City, is set 
for a revival. While it may just be a cosmetic update, it's nonetheless 
important for Honda since the City anchors the company's India sales and 
is one of the top selling cars in the C-segment.

To re-register its grip over the segment by taking the first mover's 
advantage, Honda would want to launch the City facelift in India ahead 
of Ciaz facelift which could be here in March-April 2017. The Ciaz 
outsold the City in 2016 by a margin of 5000-odd units.

http://secure.kashmirmonitor.in/Upload_Images/Upload_Images_Articles/1bb6bb3c-19b0-469b-993d-ab8898d4e51d.JPGThe 
City facelift recently made way into the Thai market and rumours were 
rife that it would come to India as early as January 2017. Our sources, 
however, point to a Feb 2017 launch. Dealerships in Delhi are accepting 
bookings for the updated model as some buyers are ready to wait out for 
the new City.

Official bookings for the updated model are expected to commence in the 
last week of January 2017. Honda dealerships are therefore in the 
process of selling off their existing City stock by offering juicy deals 
on top of cartel discount.

The City facelift for the Thai market gets a mildly reworked fascia with 
a new bumper and a new sleeker front grille. The most talked-about 
update is the inclusion of LED headlamps in the package that may make 
way into the Indian market as well. Honda City's chief rival in India 
and the current segment leader, Maruti Suzuki Ciaz, already gets 
projector headlamps as standard. With Maruti Suzuki's Ignis sporting LED 
projector headlamps, we expect Maruti Suzuki to offer the same in the 
upcoming Ciaz facelift as well. The Ciaz may enter the company's premium 
retail chain, Nexa, as their fifth product, fourth being the Baleno RS 
which is due for a Feb 2017 launch.

The C-segment didn't see much happening in the year 2016 with only the 
Skoda Rapid undergoing a major cosmetic overhaul. 2017 will, however, 
see the C-segment battle heating up with the all-new Hyundai Verna set 
to arrive in the market. The Hyundai Verna was once a tough nut to crack 
in the C-segment in India. However, new product launches in the Honda 
City and the Maruti Suzuki Ciaz took Hyundai completely off-guard and 
outnumbered the Verna on sales charts.

The new Verna is expected to make a strong comeback in India riding high 
on features. Importantly, Hyundai is expected to power the new Verna 
with a mild-hybrid diesel engine as seen on the Maruti Suzuki Ciaz SHVS 
(more on the new Verna and other upcoming Hyundais here.)

The meeting with Donald Trump presents automakers with a key opportunity 
to weigh in on issues the administration plans to tackle, including 
trade, regulatory and tax reforms

Washington: President Donald Trump met Tuesday with the chief executives 
of the big three US automakers as he looks to persuade car manufacturers 
to keep production within the country.

“I want new plants to be built here for cars sold here!” Trump said in a 
posting on Twitter before the meeting in Washington on Tuesday.

The heads of Ford Motor Co., Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and General 
Motors Co. attended the meeting at the White House. The meeting presents 
Detroit’s automakers with a key opportunity to weigh in on major issues 
the administration plans to tackle in its earliest days, including 
trade, regulatory and tax reforms.

“He looks forward to hearing their ideas, on how we can work together to 
bring more jobs back to this industry in particular,” White House press 
secretary Sean Spicer said.

Ford CEO Mark Fields planned to discuss corporate tax reform, the need 
for “data-driven regulations” and trade policy initiatives that address 
foreign currency manipulation, Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said. GM 
CEO Mary Barra and Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne also planned to 
attend, according to spokeswomen for the two companies prior to the 
gathering.

Trump met Monday with prominent American manufacturers including Elon 
Musk, the head of Tesla Motors Inc., and said he would dramatically cut 
regulations and corporate taxes. But Trump said manufacturers would face 
tough penalties if they move production outside the country. Fields also 
attended that meeting.

Cutting regulations

“We think we can cut regulations by 75%. Maybe more,” Trump said. “When 
you want to expand your plant, or when Mark wants to come in and build a 
big massive plant, or when Dell wants to come in and do something 
monstrous and special—you’re going to have your approvals really fast.”

After the meeting, Fields said he was confident Trump was “very serious 
on making sure the US economy is going to be strong and have policies—on 
tax, regulatory or trade—to drive that.”

Trump has openly agitated for US automakers to keep jobs in the US and 
cancel plans to build plants abroad.

“Car companies and others, if they want to do business in our country, 
have to start making things here again. WIN!” Trump tweeted on Sunday.

Domestic investments

All three automakers have given Trump fodder for promoting his efforts 
to boost US hiring. Ford cancelled a $1.6 billion car assembly plant in 
Mexico and has said it will spend $700 million to expand a Michigan 
factory instead. GM and Fiat Chrysler have each pledged $1 billion in 
investment toward domestic assembly, though both companies have said 
their plans were made prior to Trump winning the election.

All three also continue to produce vehicles in Mexico. Ford will 
assemble Focus compacts at an existing factory in Hermosillo already 
building Fusion and Lincoln MKZ sedans.

GM hasn’t announced any step back from plans announced in late 2014 that 
it would spend $5 billion on new plants in the country by 2018, creating 
5,600 jobs. Fiat Chrysler has seven facilities south of the border 
building parts as well as Ram trucks and vans, Fiat 500 small cars and 
Dodge Journey sport utility vehicles.

In November, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers sent an eight-page 
letter to the Trump transition team with a series of recommendations, 
including aligning programs run by the EPA and the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration. Inconsistent rules threaten to saddle the 
industry with “potentially billions of dollars in fines,” said the trade 
group, which represents most of the world’s biggest automakers including 
GM, Ford, Toyota and Volkswagen AG.

The alliance asked for a presidential panel to review all auto 
regulations, including fuel-economy rules, as consumers continue to 
reject efficient cars and electrified vehicles in favour of pickups and 
SUVs.

“The combination of low gas prices and the existing fuel efficiency 
gains from the early years of the program is undercutting consumer 
willingness to buy the vehicles with more expensive alternative 
powertrains,” the group said. Bloomberg

**Audi etches symbols into car paint
*Automotive World 
<http://automotiveworld.com/news-releases/audi-etches-symbols-car-paint/>

Audi has developed a process for the partial matting of painted 
surfaces. A special powder roughens the clear lacquer on the surface to 
a depth of a few thousandths of a millimeter so that individual markings 
become visible. With this process, the Audi exclusive program offers 
personalized design of the side blades for all R8 customers.

images (2)The process developed by Audi experts makes each Audi unique. 
As the desired symbols are applied to components after being painted, 
the process can easily be integrated into normal series production. “The 
method of partial matting is an excellent example of the flexibility of 
our production. Being able to implement individualization in normal 
series production is one of the aims of our smart factory,” stated Prof. 
Dr. Hubert Waltl, Member of the Board of Management for Production at 
AUDI AG.

Painting an automobile consists of – in addition to the cathodic dip 
coating to protect against corrosion – at least three further coats: 
filler, base coat and the transparent lacquer as the top protective 
coat. With the newly developed process, a template of the desired 
pattern is first placed on the component. A blasting system then sprays 
a special powder onto the surface, which roughens the clear lacquer to a 
depth of just a few thousandths of a millimeter – less than a tenth of 
the thickness of a human hair. This creates the effect of a matt and 
homogeneous pattern.

“With this process, we modify the brilliance of the paintwork and the 
intensity of its sheen. Light hitting the surface is then reflected 
diffusely by the individualized surface areas. This makes it appear 
matt,” explained project manager Dr. Erhard Brandl. Production section 
head Mirko Endres added: “This form of individualization is weather 
resistant, unlike conventional lettering and stickers, and it has a much 
more high-quality appearance.”

The Audi paint shop can apply almost any pattern that a customer might 
desire and which does not affect any third-party rights. At present, 
components with a size up to a meter by a meter can be processed in this 
way. The super sports car Audi R8 is the first model for which this 
technology is offered through the Audi exclusive individualization 
program. If desired, R8 customers can have their individual lettering 
and graphics applied to the side blades of the Coupe and the open Spyder 
version. It is planned to extend the offer to other models in the future.

Fuel consumption of the models named above:

·Audi R8 Coupe:

·Combined fuel consumption in l/100 km: 12.3-11.4

·CO2 emissions combined in g/km: 287-272

·Audi R8 Spyder:

·Combined fuel consumption in l/100 km: 11.7

·CO2 emissions combined in g/km: 277

*Automotive World 
<http://automotiveworld.com/news-releases/bmw-mini-driving-experience-relaunches-usa/>

BMW of North America is allowing customers to experience the successful 
driver training courses of the BMW and MINI Driving Experience in the 
USA too. The BMW Performance Center West in southern California and the 
BMW Performance Center East in Spartanburg now bear the seal of quality 
“BMW Driving Experience, Official Partner of BMW M.” The basis for this 
is the successful certification by a team of inspectors from the BMW and 
MINI Driving Experience in Germany. The first international location to 
be awarded this status was the BMW and MINI Driving Experience in the 
Netherlands in 2015.

“We are pleased to present the second partner in the 
internationalisation of our successful driver safety programme at the 
BMW and MINI Driving Experience,” said Frank van Meel, President of BMW 
M GmbH. “As with the pilot project in the Netherlands, the BMW 
Performance Centers in the USA fully comply with all the prerequisites 
for the certification. Because of this, our customers in North America 
can now look forward to training courses that meet the high standards of 
the BMW and MINI Driving Experience in Germany.”

“The BMW Performance Center in Spartanburg has been helping drivers 
improve their skills, become safer drivers and experience the Ultimate 
Driving Machine in a very dynamic way since 1999. Now with the 
completion of our new BMW Performance Center West, we are better able to 
serve our many west coast customers.” stated Ludwig Willisch President 
and CEO of BMW of North America, LLC. “With this certification by BMW M, 
we can ensure consistency of our BMW and MINI Driving Experiences at 
both US locations and worldwide.” continued Willisch.

MINI Driving Experience in North America. It is located a few kilometres 
outside La Quinta, about two hours’ drive southeast of Los Angeles and 
was the second of its type in the USA when it was opened in 2014. It 
covers an area of about 130,000 m² and features a 2.25-kilometre circuit 
with a 25,000-m² paddock, a skid pad, and a 790-m² performance facility. 
The BMW Performance Center West is located on the premises of partner 
and premium automobile club “The Thermal Club”. 8.9 kilometres of 
racetrack and areas for maintenance and repairs are available here. The 
main building has a 21-metre control tower, while an outbuilding houses 
the fleet of track cars and safety cars.

The range of courses on offer at the BMW Performance Center West is 
extensive. Car Control Clinics and Teen Driving Schools are aimed at 
young drivers and beginners. Offerings such as the M School and Advanced 
M School cater for more advanced drivers and the field of racing. 
Tailored programmes, such as those for business customers, are also 
available.

In 1999, BMW opened the BMW Performance Center East not far from the BMW 
plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina. This was the company’s first 
permanent performance driving centre in the USA. Since its opening, more 
than 161,000 BMW customers have taken part in courses. More than 9,700 
customers have attended courses at the BMW Performance Center West in 
the first two years since it was opened.

The international certification concept developed by the BMW and MINI 
Driving Experience in Germany is aimed at ensuring all locations meet or 
exceed uniform, premium global standards regarding the customer 
experience. Customers benefit from the specific know-how and experience 
of the BMW instructors in regions all over the world. After the 
Netherlands and the USA, further certifications are being prepared in 
South Korea, South Africa and Scandinavia.

Experience is part of BMW M GmbH. As one of the first provides of driver 
training courses, it has been thrilling its customers with driving

powerful BMW M vehicles.

period of around two months.

Tata Motors is working on reducing the waiting period for their new 
lifestyle utility vehicle, Hexa. The new vehicle (Hexa) has a waiting 
period of around two months.Pratap Bose, design head, Tata Motors, said 
the Hexa has received significant bookings and the company was carrying 
out production to match the demand and was doing everything possible to 
start deliveries soon. He did not disclose the exact number of bookings 
for the Hexa but said the response was good.

The automatic variants of the Hexa has generated a lot of interest among 
customers, Bose said. The culture of weekend getaways is taken off in a 
big way and this combined with the need to travel within the city 
traffic during weekdays made the Hexa an attractive option, he said.

Bose was speaking at the launch of the Hexa in the Pune and rest of 
Maharashtra markets.

Tata Motors is wooing potential customers by taking the Hexa to their 
doorstep and making customers experience the cars. “This customized, 
personalized and dedicated service started with the Tiago and is being 
continued with the Hexa” he said.

This was part of the strategy to bring the service industry mindset to 
their industry, Bose said. The company is also using the “influencers” 
from across strata of society from actors, cricketers, TV celebrities to 
fashion designers to share their experience about the vehicle. These 
vehicles were given to them for a few days and then their feedback 
sought, which is being used to sell the vehicle.

Here is a quick look at Maruti Suzuki’s line for assembling the Swift 
and the Baleno at its Manesar Plant in Haryana.

Henry Ford first introduced assembly line production in 1913. This has 
made car manufacturing faster over the years.

The step-by-step progress in the manufacture of cars has seen 
innumerable innovations and process improvements which have enabled high 
volume production at the lowest possible costs. Last year, nearly 70 
million passenger vehicles rolled off the assembly lines worldwide.
