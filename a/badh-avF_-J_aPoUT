I love this tool! Would have preferred better tracks for the miter guides, but that's an easy work-around. I also Mounted it on a Bosch TS200 Gravity Rise stand to make it faster and easier to set up. I saved the stand it came with, and the twist plugs to mount it, and next I plan to cut and drill a piece of 3/4" plywood to fit over the stand it came with, for a small and low collapsible workbench I can use while sitting down, even when I'm watching TV if I choose.
