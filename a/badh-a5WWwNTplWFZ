About.me (Usually styled as about.me) is a personal web hosting service co-founded by Ryan Freitas, Tony Conrad and Tim Young in October 2009. The site offers registered users a simple platform from which to link multiple online identities, relevant external sites, and popular social networking websites such as Facebook, Flickr, Google+, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Twitter, Tumblr, and YouTube. It is characterized by its one-page user profiles, each with a large, often-artistic background image and abbreviated biography.

On December 20, 2010, just four days after its public launch, About.me was acquired by AOL. The company remained at AOL for a little over twenty-five months. On February 5, 2013, it was announced that Conrad had bought back majority control of About.me from AOL; although no specifics were revealed on the purchase price, Conrad did say that it was a fraction of the price AOL paid to originally buy it. Conrad believed that there were no advantages in being owned by AOL, and that the site did not fit with AOL's c

<body>This rumor has been out there for months...<br />
<br />
But the recent debate between Donald Trump and Hillary<br />
Clinton has shown the exact opposite.<br />
<br />
<strong>The news are absolutely terrifying...</strong><br />

<br />
The elections will take place in <strong>April 2017</strong>, but the information<br />
will not be released to the public until November 6th.<br />

<br />
This is probably the biggest conspiracy of the century! And it&#39;s not just a theory...<br />
<br />
<strong>This documentary has been banned all over the US... and for good reason.</strong><br />
Minute 2:43 will completely blow your mind!<br />

It is mainly aimed at being a professional profile page and it is free as well. Another alternative is the website called medotcom.com which is different as it offers a search bar, live stats and addresses not only individuals but larger entities as well; it is free too and maybe the simplest and most straight forward of the three players with a focus on social media, online presence and getting discovered and being reached easily. There are also the famous flavors.me which had its sunny days and is still online.
  Finally, Wix.com can be seen as competition as well as it is free and enables you very easily to create your page and tell about you. <a href="http://hodftea.top/VHAnhMpqXClOHlP91PTrFfA95VSFPZgXKugqmg"><img src="http://hodftea.top/b1d83d3dd0fd29f23c.jpg" /></a> <img height="1" src="http://www.hodftea.top/Vn4ssDcTlFA0l2HwJxlkYbIKIYvi5OjKep8IPg" width="1" /></p>
