Hi Friend!,

I've sent some pretty cool ideas out over the months, but this has to be one of the best ideas out there.. And greenest too!

The idea is to build a home from an old shipping container. I've teamed up with a fella that goes by the name of Warren Thatcher.

=> Check out some of his creative designs here
http://www.buildhom.bid/l/lt12T13125C810CP/4992Y12236IK21593E193R38754308Q3111078273
He's a professional builder by trade. But, not your average builder.

You see, he uses old shipping containers to build exciting and creative homes for a fraction of the price of building a home using conventional methods.

Warren's been building container homes for the past 14 years and over that time he's helped hundreds of others build their very own container home. 	


No he's really putting his knowledge to the test because he's personally invited you to try out his DIY container home plans.

=> See the plans

Go ahead, take a look at Warren's plans and designs. Some of them are really cool and it's hard to believe he's used old shipping containers for the foundation.

=> Look at these container homes
