There are 4 blue lights on the front that indicate the power remaining. There are 2 ports so you can charge multiple devices at one time. The only way to check the capacity is to plug a device into it. One thing that really impressed me is that the capacity is accurate. So often battery capacities are exaggerated. Not here, this is rated 4000 mAh and when I tested it the result was 4351 mAh.

I received this item at a discount in exchange for an impartial review. Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped “aspherical” elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. 

Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality.
