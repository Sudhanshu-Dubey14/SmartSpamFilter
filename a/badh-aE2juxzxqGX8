**Demonetisation affected repayment of auto loans: Fitch Ratings*

Hindustan Times 
<http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/demonetisation-affected-repayment-of-auto-loans-fitch-ratings/story-Y8sGqFS3K9DdmzouaLm9rI.html>

Global credit rating agency Fitch Ratings on Friday said repayment of 
Indian auto loans got affected by demonetisation and it would take a 
couple of months for collections to come back to normal levels.

download (7)In a statement, Fitch said: “Demonetisation appears to have 
had a negative impact on Indian auto loan repayments, based on 
collection reports from Fitch-rated securitisation transactions.”

“It is possible that collections will fall further in early 2017, and we 
believe it could take at least another two to three months for 
collections to return to normal,” Fitch added.

According to Fitch, small auto loan borrowers have been affected the 
most but that would not impact credit ratings as there are sufficient 
external credit enhancement to cover the likely short-term impact on the 
lenders rated by it.

Fitch said the cash shortage has affected used vehicle operators more 
than the new vehicle borrowers.

Pools backed predominantly by used vehicle loans saw an average drop in 
collections of 130 basis points (bp) in November 2016. Those with a 
higher concentration of light and small commercial vehicles, which again 
have relatively weaker borrower credit profiles compared with medium and 
heavy vehicle owners, also dropped significantly by almost 200bp, Fitch 
said.

The collection of pools securitised in 2016 fell by an average 120bp 
compared with 80bp for pools securitised before 2016.

More seasoned pools are on an average likely to have more experienced 
borrowers, with a stronger ability to meet their repayments.

Furthermore, borrowers in seasoned pools will on an average have 
serviced their loans for longer and have higher equity than those in 
less seasoned pools, leading to a greater willingness to pay.

All Fitch-rated transactions are currently able to withstand a 30 per 
cent drop in collections for a minimum of eight months and an average of 
22 months, the rating agency said.

*Union Budget 2017 should give impetus on R&D, says ZF India***

The Economic Times

"The government has been working tirelessly to develop the manufacturing 
sector and hence ZF India hopes that Union budget 2017 will bear good 
tidings for the company."

NEW DELHI: The Indian arm of automotive components manufacturer ZF 
thinks impetus on R&D should be one of the priorities of the Union 
Budget 2017 as it will create infrastructure for innovative companies to 
make India a sourcing hub for innovative products.

Related imageSuresh KV - Country Head of ZF in India said, "The Indian 
Automotive industry is no doubt one of the prominent growth drivers of 
our economy. ZF recognizes the myriad of opportunities this country has 
to offer and hence our focus is to expand our footprints in India."

He further added, "With some effective policies and regulations like GST 
to be introduced we at ZF feel that positive sentiments will be restored 
in the Auto Component sector. Overall, the government has been working 
tirelessly to develop the manufacturing sector and hence we hope that 
Union budget 2017 will bear good tidings for us and the sector overall."

Overall, the Indian automotive components industry is expecting the 
forthcoming Union Budget 2017 to uplift the market sentiments which will 
allow for growth and development of the sector.

Apart from this, they are also demanding to increase the weighted

response from CCI and Meru Cabs asked parties to maintain status quo 
till February 17, the next date of hearing.

Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Uber, argued that the 
tribunal without forming any prima facie opinion ordered investigations 
by the director general, CCI.

“Compat on an appeal can only confirm, modify or set aside the CCI’s 
order. It is a complete reversal. Even for modifying, it has to form a 
prima facie opinion,” he argued.

However, senior counsel Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for Meru, opposed 
any stay, saying “they (Uber) are in a dominating position. Compat has 
given detailed reasons for disagreeing with CCI… If CCI can send it (for 
investigations), so can Compat.”

The Compat had in December last year ordered probe after Meru Travels 
Solutions challenged the CCI’s earlier decision that refused to order 
probe into allegations against Uber’s unfair practices including 
predatory pricing.

The tribunal had directed CCI’s probe unit Director General (DG) to 
conduct a fresh probe into the allegations of abuse of dominance and 
anti-competitive practices by Uber. The CCI in February last year had 
rejected Meru’s complaint, saying inability of the existing players to 
match the innovative technology of any player or the model created for 
operating in a particular industry cannot be said to be creating entry 
barriers in itself.

“The size of discounts and incentives shows there are either phenomenal 
efficiency improvements which are replacing existing business models 
with the new business models or there could be an anti-competitive 
stance to it,” the tribunal had said.

As per Meru’s complaint, Uber allegedly resorted to many abusive 
practices with the sole intent to

establish its monopoly and eliminate otherwise equally efficient 
competitors from the market by way of discounts and incentives. It was 
alleged that Uber is spending about $885 million to generate a revenue 
of $415 million.

The two — taxi-hailing apps like Uber and radio taxi service providers 
like Meru — are locked in a stiff competition all across the country. 
Taking note of Uber’s substantial market share, Compat said, besides the 
appellant (Meru), there are a few very small players in the market who 
can be seriously affected if any of the bigger players adopts 
anti-competitive practices.

It also observed that aggregator-based radio taxi service is a new 
paradigm of public transport in Indian cities which has revolutionised 
the manner in which we commute and work.

*Ford is undergoing a huge business transformation-but its future still 
includes dealers***

Business Insider 
<http://www.businessinsider.in/ford-is-undergoing-a-huge-business-transformation-but-its-future-still-includes-dealers/articleshow/56820031.cms>

MATTHEW DEBORD0JAN

Car dealers have been around for as long as there have been cars - and 
for over 100 years, many of those dealers have sold Fords.

The oldest Ford dealership dates to 1903, and the automaker now has over 
3,000 Ford and Lincoln "stores," as they're called in the industry, in 
the US alone.

Donald Trump Mark Fields The National Automobile Dealers Association 
annual convention runs through this weekend in New Orleans, and Ford CEO 
Mark Fields and Stephen Odell, Ford's Executive Vice-President for 
Marketing, Sales and Service - the carmaker's point person for its 
dealers - took some time to talk to Business Insider before they faced 
some of their most important customers in the Big Easy. We addressed the 
inevitable questions about Ford's future and its relationship to 
President Donald Trump's administration.

Major changes

The dealership business has gone through major changes in the past two 
decades. The internet has opened new avenues for buyers and leasers to 
research vehicles, obtain financing, and manage service. Since Tesla 
emerged as the first significant new American auto company in half a 
century, the longstanding dealer-franchise business model has also come 
under attack. This is because Tesla's CEO Elon Musk strives to develop 
an alternative, direct-sales process.

At the same time, dealers have adapted, and in the US, many are thriving 
as the market sets new sales highs. In 2016, 17.55 million new cars and 
trucks rolled out of showrooms, and many of those vehicles were sold by 
Ford dealers. The automaker is second only to GM in US market share, and 
its F-Series trucks were once again America's best-selling vehicles in 2016.

"Stephen and I both started our careers in marketing sales and in the 
field," he said. "We have a visceral understanding of the role the 
dealers play."

Both Fields and Odell emphasized Ford's firm commitment to the franchise 
model.

"We firmly believe in the franchise model around the world," Odell said, 
highlighting Ford's global footprint, which is currently expanding in 
countries such as China, where 65 Lincoln dealerships have been added 
since the brand arrived there in 2014.

But Ford also wants to help its dealers move into the 21st century, 
especially as the carmaker pursues Fields vision of becoming both a car 
company and a mobility provider.

The transformation of Ford

Ford has established a presence in Silicon Valley. The automaker 
acquired Chariot, a San Francisco-based shuttle service, last year and 
created Ford Smart Mobility in early 2016 to coordinate its efforts in 
the space. The company asked Jim Hackett, former CEO of Steelcase and 
confidant of Ford Chairman Bill Ford, Jr., to leave the Ford board to 
run the new group.

What's more, the company has also pledged to get a fully autonomous 
vehicle on the road by 2021 and has launched its City of Tomorrow 
initiative, which works with urban leaders and Bloomberg Philanthropies 
to create new ways of getting around in congested metropolitan environments.

Ford Chariot

Car dealers are understandably concerned about these moves, as on their 
face they suggest a company moving away from a time-honored business 
model of building cars and then sending them to dealers to sell, lease, 
finance, and service.

"Dealers are asking more and more what their role is for the future, but 
the dealership model has longevity beyond what people think it does," 
Odell said.

"Switched-on dealers are asking how they can participate, and I don't 
think there's panic."

But he added that dealers' questions to Ford's leadership are " becoming 
more pointed because of what they see in the press."

Repeating history

Fields pointed out that dealers have been through this before, when the 
internet arrived and the old ritual of going down to the showroom, 
picking up an armful of brochures, and bringing them home to spread out 
on the kitchen table so the family could salivate over a new car was 
displaced by clicking through vehicle configurations, reviews, and 
best-price aggregators online.

"I've always been impressed by the capability of our dealers to adapt," 
Fields said, adding that when the internet became a bigger part of 
buying a car, people said dealers weren't long for the world.

"We found and that people do still want to see, and touch, and feel the 
car," he said.

Fields said that although Ford has a vision for the future, it can't 
predict exactly what the market will look like in ten or 15 years. But 
he insisted that Ford and its dealers will be on a shared journey - a 
journey that acknowledges dealers have the best view of what's happening 
on the ground, day to day.

"What we're not going do is say 'This how you should run your 
business,'" Fields said. "We're just saying, 'Here's our view of the 
world, let's work together to get there.'"

City of Tomorrow

Ford City of Tomorrow

For Fields and Ford, that view of the world has a strong urban 
component, and that's why the company has been developing its City of 
Tomorrow ideas , laying them out at the Los Angeles auto show late last 
year and again at the Detroit auto show In January.

These ideas are futuristic and don't rely on owning a vehicle to obtain 
transportation. Rather, the company seeks to improve economic activity 
and quality of life by cutting down on pollution and congestion, and 
that entails deep and systemic thinking about how, for example, 
President's Trump's proposed infrastructure spending can bolster urban 
mobility.

"We've taken a view of what the city of tomorrow will look like," Fields 
said.

The CEO has met twice with Trump since the inauguration and said that 
new urban infrastructure "can't just be cutting and pasting what we've 
done in past - it's an opportunity for planners to rethink every aspect 
of the city."

The mass implementation of what Fields called a "transportation 
operating system," featuring everything from connected cars and 
autonomous vehicles to shared mobility, smarter mass-transit, and even 
drones. All of these changes will be a challenge for dealers, but they 
also have an opportunity similar to what they experienced when the 
internet arrived.

"City solutions are going be local solutions," Odell said. "Dealers know 
how the community operates, so their ideas and solutions will be 
welcome. The core business isn't going away, and electric and autonomous 
vehicles will still need to be maintained and repaired."

He added that Ford dealers are something of a secret weapon for the 
company as the transportation landscape is transformed.

"Other businesses called 'disruptors' look very jealously at the 10,000 
dealer locations we have around the world," Odell said.

EU to make it difficult for automakers to cheat on emissions
*ABR - News 
<http://automobiletechnology.automotive-business-review.com/news/eu-introduces-tougher-guidelines-for-member-states-on-vehicular-emissions-270117-5725206>

The European Commission has presented guidance for member states to 
crack down on automakers violating diesel emissions regulations.

The guidance will help member states assess if car manufacturers use 
defeat devices or other strategies resulting in higher vehicle emissions 
outside of the test cycle and analyse whether they are technically 
justified.

The guidelines have been published in the wake of dieselgate scandal by 
Volkswagen in 2015.

Recently, the EU started taking legal action against Germany, Britain 
and five other nations for not complying with the law related to 
emissions defeat devices.

The European Commission noted that as per the EU law, defeat devices 
have been banned since 1998 and automakers are obligated to comply with 
this law.

The rules say that it is the responsibility of national authorities and 
their respective technical services to enforce this law.

The commission noted that it has already given important steps to 
improve emissions testing under real driving conditions, which is 
believed to reduce the chances of cheating.

Apart from this, as per a new law passed in 2016, automakers need to 
declare and get approval of their emissions reductions strategy before 
they can bring a car into the market.

The new law also focuses on putting an obligation on automakers to offer 
access to their emissions software protocol to respective national 
authorities.

As per EU, member-states are investigating automakers for emissions 
defeat devices or strategies and some states noted that some of these 
emissions devices or strategies are legal and justified as they are 
being claimed to be in place to protect the engine.

While other member-states argue that the new guidelines are vague and 
lack clarity on the ban and its exemptions.

The commission also noted that prior to Volkswagen’s dieselgate scandal, 
no member-state or automaker raised the issue of lack of clarity.

European Commission Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs 
Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska said: "National investigations into the 
emissions scandal are revealing that a large number of car manufacturers 
use strategies that increase emissions outside of the test cycle.

“This is illegal unless technically justified in exceptional cases, and 
the burden of proof lies with the carmaker. Cheating cannot be 
tolerated. Today we are offering guidance to Member States on how to 
enforce the law better."

As per the guidelines, a car manufacturer using emissions abatement 
strategies is required to justify questions like the increase of 
emissions kept at the lowest possible leve and is there no better 
technology or design on the market that would allow for improved 
emission control or safer operation of the engine.

*Mitsubishi Motors fined $4 miilion for faking fuel consumption data***

IANS / BS 
<http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/mitsubishi-fined-for-faking-fuel-consumption-data-117012700763_1.html>

In a statement, the country's Consumer Affairs Agency said it imposed 
the fine based on evidence that Mitsubishi Motors marketed the cars 
under inflated fuel economy claims, Efe news reported.

TOKYO: Japan imposed a fine of 480 million yen (about $4 million) on 
auto giant Mitsubishi Motors on Friday, for falsifying fuel consumption 
data of several of its mini vehicles.

In a statement, the country's Consumer Affairs Agency said it imposed 
the fine based on evidence that the company marketed the cars under 
inflated fuel economy claims, Efe news reported.

In April 2016, Mitsubishi admitted it had systematically falsified fuel 
consumption data in four models of mini vehicles -- cars with engines 
smaller than 660 cubic centimeters -- including two sold by Nissan 
Motor, and later acknowledged that more models were affected.

The manipulated data, that appeared on sales pamphlets with Mitsubishi 
and Nissan dealers as also in advertising campaigns, indicated fuel 
spent by the automobiles was 5 to 15 percent lower than what they 
actually consumed.

Over 625,000 units of these mini vehicles -- highly popular in Japan due 
to their small size and lower fuel consumption -- were sold in the 
archipelago under the false claims.

Following the scandal and ensuing financial troubles for Mitsubishi, 
Nissan bought a 34 percent stake in the company in October last year to 
salvage consumer confidence and return the firm to profitability, 
according to the new senior management.

*'US auto sales likely to report record high of 17.6 million vehicles in 
2017'*

REUTERS <http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-autos-idUSKBN15B1JH>

US auto sales led the economy out of the 2008-2009 economic crisis. Wall 
Street automotive company analysts have been predicting a downturn in 
sales since at least 2015 and so far, the market has surpassed those 
expectations.

'US auto sales likely to report record high of 17.6 million vehicles in 
2017''US auto sales likely to report record high of 17.6 million 
vehicles in 2017' - ImageDETROIT: US auto sales are expected to remain 
robust and scale a record high of 17.6 million vehicles in 2017, lifted 
by expected fiscal stimulus and deregulatory policies of President 
Donald Trump, consultancies JD Power and LMC Automotive said on Friday.

The consultancies see January keeping sales robust at an annualised rate 
of 17.3 million vehicles, although falling 1.8 percent from last January.

January sales will be about 1.13 million vehicles, JD Power and LMC said.

It would be the third consecutive year of a record high for total light 
vehicle sales.

US auto sales led the economy out of the 2008-2009 economic crisis. Wall 
Street automotive company analysts have been predicting a downturn in 
sales since at least 2015 and so far, the market has surpassed those 
expectations.

“After an overheated close to 2016 and the increased likelihood of 
deregulation and fiscal stimulus from the Trump administration driving 
the economy higher, we now expect 2017 to be another record year in US 
auto sales," said Jeff Schuster, head of forecasting at LMC Automotive.

"While there are many variables to consider this year, one area of 
caution is the large number of lease maturities repopulating the 
used-car market," he said. "It creates demand for a vehicle, but also 
more used-vehicle options to compete with the new-vehicle market.”

Edmunds, an automotive consultant and online sales site, said 2017 will 
show a record 31 percent of new vehicles purchased through leasing.

JD Power and LMC said January will show record average selling prices of 
about $31,500 per vehicle, high inventory levels and rising consumer 
discounts. Also, pickup trucks and SUVs will continue to account for 
more than 60 percent of the market, they said.

Edmunds said on Wednesday January US auto sales will have an annualised 
selling rate of 17.7 million vehicles. Total light vehicle sales were 
expected to be 1.53 million vehicles, up 0.7 percent from a year earlier.

January US auto sales will be reported by automakers on Wednesday.

*Luxury / Sports Cars

SUVs take the lead in luxury class
*Business Standard 
<http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/demand-for-luxury-suvs-strengthen-in-a-sluggish-market-117012700895_1.html>

The trend of steep growth in demand for sports utility vehicles (SUVs) 
is not just limited to the mass market for passenger vehicles.

Affluent buyers of luxury cars are also demonstrating a rising 
preference for these vehicles that offer a stronger road presence, 
greater comfort and safety. Luxury car makers are seeing a strong demand 
for SUVs in an otherwise sluggish market.

Related image"SUV is the strongest growing segment from our perspective 
and enquiries remain strong. For us, the volumes of SUV grew by 50% in 
2016. As of now, about 40% of our sales come from SUVs," said Roland 
Folger, managing director and chief executive officer at Mercedes Benz, 
country's biggest luxury car player. Mercedes sold 13,231 units in the 
Indian market last calendar year against its best ever annual volume of 
13,502 units in 2015.

The growth of SUV sales in the luxury car market is identical to the 
strong growth seen in the mass market for passenger vehicles. SUVs are 
the fastest growing segment in the passenger vehicle space.

Unlike cars and vans which are struggling to post a high single-digit 
growth, SUVs are clocking a high double-digit growth. In the first nine 
months of FY17, domestic sales of cars and vans grew at 2.4% and 1.7% 
respectively. SUVs stole the show with a 33% growth. In fact, it is the 
SUVs that are driving growth in the domestic passenger vehicle market. 
Every fourth passenger vehicle sold in the country is now a SUV. The 
number was one out of five a year ago.

People are reacting to SUVs much more than traditional sedans across the 
age group. "Many now prefer SUVs due to its sitting position which gives 
you a better control. We have seven models in our SUV range. Such a 
range is not there with most players in the mass market," said Folger.

Interestingly, most of the luxury SUVs are diesel cars but saw little 
impact of the uncertainties arising out of the eight-month long diesel 
ban (lifted in August 2016) in national capital region.

The other two leading luxury car makers did not share specific numbers 
related to SUV but maintained that they are witnessing a strong demand 
for these vehicles. "The demand for our cars including SUVs have grown 
in the last couple of years. Spurred by the demand for our SUVs, we are 
now locally producing all our Q range models (Audi Q3, Audi Q5, Audi 
Q7). A popular choice of the Bollywood celebrities and big 
industrialists, the Audi Q7 paved the way for the luxury SUV market," 
Audi said in response to the query

*Audi can prosper in the industry's brave new world, Keogh says***

Automotive News <v>

NEW ORLEANS -- Self-driving cars and electric vehicles will present 
challenges to the industry, but Audi of America President Scott Keogh 
says they offer huge opportunities for Audi.

http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CA/20170127/RETAIL06/170129854/AR/0/AR-170129854.jpgIn 
a speech at J.D. Power’s Automotive Summit on Thursday afternoon, Keogh 
outlined how he expects Audi’s role to evolve in the coming era.

“In the 21st century there is going to be a jump ball or a reset in the 
marketplace that says who is going to be the new luxury leader in a 
connected, piloted, electric world and without a doubt -- irrefutably -- 
I want that and it will be Audi,” Keogh said.

To meet challenges from other automakers and companies such as Tesla, 
Apple, Google and Nvidia, he said Audi and its dealers must maintain a 
balanced perspective -- both short term and long term.

Near term, they’ll need to continue to boost throughput and gain market 
share.

“You have to have scale and market share to make a presence in the 
marketplace Keogh said. “This is why we’ve been so focused on gaining 
share.”

Just not with heavy incentives.

“That is a very, very profoundly dangerous game and the reason it’s a 
dangerous game is you end up telling the customer ‘this thing that I 
sell has diminished value,’” Keogh said.

Audi will also do whatever it can to keep mix and inventory levels just 
right -- aiming at just a 60-day supply of its vehicles.

While scale and market share grow, Keogh said Audi and its dealers can 
prepare for the next step: widespread adoption of groundbreaking 
technologies such as autonomous and battery electric vehicles.

Rather than fear this shift because of the expected reduction in service 
tickets, he said dealers should embrace the opportunity to be the 
gateway to new technology.

Customers moving into a self-driving vehicle with a plug will need 
dealership guidance much more than in the days when a new car meant 
learning about a new volume knob or e-brake lever.

Such opportunities will need to compensate for revenue streams that 
service departments will lose because of EVs with fewer moving parts.

“This is huge, this is a massive competitive advantage dealers have,” 
Keogh told the audience. “You have a golden opportunity to be the entry 
point for this entire new world order.”
