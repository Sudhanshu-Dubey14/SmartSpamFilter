Hi,

Please do accept to partner with me on this urgent proposal. I got your con=
tact through a private search on a directory and had a deep feeling that yo=

I am Kevin Doran, the Chief financial officer from a Bank, here in United K=
ingdom. The reason for this email is to seek your partnership for a busines=
s transaction that will give us a great opportunity of being in possession =
of an unclaimed sum of $12.5M (Twelve Million, Five Hundred Thousand United=
 States Dollars Only), an investment deposit that belongs to our late forei=
gn Customer.

The reason for contacting you came as a result of the need to present a for=
eigner as a beneficiary to the fund since our bank has not seen any of the =
relatives that came up to claim this fund, and also for the fact that the b=
oard has resolved to allow this fund to be confiscated by the British Gover=
nment in the event that no beneficiary comes up. As an officer of this bank=
, I cannot be directly connected to this money, so my basic aim of contacti=
ng you is to assist me receive this money in your bank account as a benefic=
iary, and get 40% of the total funds as commission.

I will provide you with all the necessary information and documents from th=
e involved authorities to legally back up the claim, so that this $12.5M wi=
ll be transferred to your nominated account successfully.

If this proposal satisfies your interest, then get back to me with the belo=
w information: FULL NAMES, TELEPHONE/FAX, MOBILE NUMBERS, ADDRESS, AGE / SE=
X and OCCUPATION.

ust I have bestowed on you. I assure you we can achieve it successfully.
