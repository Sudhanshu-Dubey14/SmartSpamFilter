Stephanie Smith Solicitors & Associates
30 Bloomsbury Square London,
WC1A2LS, United Kingdom

I am the personal attorney to Steven Vandersande, a Netherland who was a co=
nsultant with Shell UK LTD here in London, who hereinafter shall be referre=
d to as my client. Unfortunately My Client lost his life in a plane crash M=
H17 on the 17th July, 2014 during one of his trip from Netherlands (Amsterd=
am) to Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur) http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-2835788=
0 and my client left no clear beneficiary to the fund deposited with a Secu=
rity Company as Next of Kin except some vital documents related to the depo=
sit that is still with me.

All efforts by me to trace his Next of Kin and relatives have proved aborti=
ve because he did not make any will prior to his death. Since then I have m=
ade several inquiries to locate any of my late clients extended relatives a=
nd this has proved unsuccessful. After my several unsuccessful attempts to =
locate any member of his family hence I contacted you.

I am contacting you to assist in claiming the money left behind by my clien=
t before they get confiscated or declared unclaimed by the security company=
 where this huge deposit was deposited. Particularly, the Finance Company w=
here He had the said fund valued at US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million Five =
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) deposited has issued me a noti=
ce to provide the next of kin. Consequent upon this, my idea is that we can=
 have a deal/agreement and I am going to do this legally with your name as =
the true beneficiary of the amount in question as I have all legal document=
 to back our claim, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin t=
o the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at $15,500,000.0=
0 Million US dollars can be paid to your account abroad, note that 40% of t=
his money will be for you, in respect to the provision of a foreign account=
 and 50% for me, 10% will be used for the reimbursement of any expenditure =
we may incur in the cause of the transaction.=20

I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that =
will protect you from any breach of the law; all I need from you is your ut=
most collaboration and sincerity for us to thrive in this deal. I want you =
to reply me immediately and include your direct phone number so that we can=
 discuss more as regard to this transaction. Thank you and Please treat thi=
s matter with utmost confidentiality. I wait your urgent response.

Yours Sincerely,
Barr. Stephanie Smith.
