							<span style="color:#ffffff;"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">On this day in 1974, Hank Aaron of the Atlanta Braves
hits his 715th career home run, breaking Babe Ruth’s legendary record of 714 homers. A crowd of 53,775 people, the largest in the history of
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, was with Aaron that night to cheer when he hit a 4th inning pitch off the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Al Downing.
However, as Aaron was an African American who had received death threats and racist hate mail during his pursuit of one of baseball’s most
distinguished records, the achievement was bittersweet.<br />
							<br />
							Henry Louis Aaron Jr., born in Mobile, Alabama, on February 5, 1934, made his Major League debut in 1954 with the Milwaukee Braves, just eight
years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball’s color barrier and became the first African American to play in the majors. Aaron, known as hard
working and quiet, was the last Negro league player to also compete in the Major Leagues. In 1957, with characteristically little fanfare, Aaron, who
primarily played right field, was named the National League’s Most Valuable Player as the Milwaukee Braves won the pennant. A few weeks later,
his three home runs in the World Series helped his team triumph over the heavily favored New York Yankees. Although “Hammerin’ Hank”
specialized in home runs, he was also an extremely dependable batter, and by the end of his career he held baseball’s career record for most
runs batted in: 2,297</font></span></div>
