gagandeep_rattan If you’re still making payments on your original student loans...

You could end up handing over tens of thousands of dollars EXTRA to your loan provider.


Money that could’ve helped you pay for an apartment.

Buy a car…

Or even start a family...

Listen, it’s no mystery student debt is a problem for college grads.

In fact, a recent video article published by ABC news revealed “3,000 Americans every single day are defaulting on a student loan. That's 1 every 28
seconds” 
It’s no surprise, considering the total student loan debt in 2018 is at $1.52 TRILLION…
