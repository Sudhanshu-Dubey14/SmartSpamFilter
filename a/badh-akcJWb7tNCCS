Compliment !

my dear i am contacting you for a business opportunity with my company. The=
 company I work with is into manufacturing of pharmaceutical material.

There is a particular raw material which the company used to send me to buy=
 in India. But now I have being promoted to a more superior post of manager=
. The company cannot send me to India again, they will send a more junior s=
taff. The director has asked for the contact of the supplier in India.

I need a person I will present to the company as the supplier in India to c=
lose the gap between the company and the local dealer. You will now buy the=
 Product from the local dealer and supply to my company.

The profit would be shared between you and I. Why I don't want the company =
to have direct contact of the local dealer is simply because,
I don't want the company to know the actual price I was buying the product.=
 If you are interested i will furnish you with more details
(frednzuana@gmail.com)
Best Regards
Dr fred nzuana
