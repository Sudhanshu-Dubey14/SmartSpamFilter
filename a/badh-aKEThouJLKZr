Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (&quot;Panthalassa&quot;, the &quot;universal sea&quot;), and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeriachars:5: 38k64 continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys ocean to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Tethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era. Large continenta
 l landmass interiors experience climates with extreme variations of heat and cold (&quot;continental climate&quot;) and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. Deserts seem to have been widespread on Pangaea. Such dry conditions favored gymnosperms, plants with seeds enclosed in a protective cover, over plants such as ferns that disperse spores in a wetnames:5: marthajimmybarbaradorothyalbertter environment. The first modern trees (conifers, ginkgos and cycads) appeared in the Permian. Three general areas are especially noted for their extensive Permian deposits &ndash; the Ural Mountains (where Perm itself is located), China, and the southwest of North America, where the Permian Basin in the U.S. state of Texas is so named because it has one of the thickest deposits of Permian rocks in the world. numbers:10,50: 0614934200975 Climate Selwyn Rock, South Australia, an exhumed glacial pavement of Permian age The climate in the Permian was quite varied.
