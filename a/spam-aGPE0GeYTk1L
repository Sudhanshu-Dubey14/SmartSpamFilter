<B>I am Mrs. Kathy Godwin, I am a US citizen, am 43 years Old. I reside here in Smithfield. My residential address is as follows. 19013 Willow Oak Drive Smithfield, Virginia 23430, United States, I'm thinking of relocating since I am now rich. I am one of those that took part in the Compensation in Nigeria many years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over $19,950USD while in the United States trying to get my payment all to no avail.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>I decided to travel down to Lagos, Nigeria with all my compensation documents and I was directed to meet Barrister Williams Darvis who is a member of COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE, I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake because the Inheritance/Compensation Law clearly states that the beneficiary/recipient is exempt from paying any out of pocket fees or charges to receive said funds.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>Barrister Williams Darvis took me to the paying bank for the claim of my Compensation payment. Right now I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $1,500,000.00 (One million five hundred thousand dollars). Moreover, Barrister Williams Darvis showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your name and email address as one of the beneficiaries that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your funds, they are only making money out of you.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>

<B>I will advise you to contact Barrister Williams Darvis, You have to contact him directly on this information below.</B></DIV>

<B>You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing. The only money I paid after I met Barrister Williams Darvis was just $350USD for the delivery charges, take note of that.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>NOTE: TELLING YOU TO PAY FOR ANY ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE OR SECURITY KEEPING FEE IS ALL NOTHING BUT LIES, I REPEAT THE ONLY MONEY YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY AND WHICH I ALSO PAID IS $350USD FOR THE DELIVERY CHARGES IMPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND YOUR PACKAGE CONTAINING YOUR CERTIFIED BANK DRAFT CHEQUE WILL BE REACHING YOU THROUGH THE ROYAL EXPRESS COURIER SERVICE.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>Once again stop contacting those people, I will advise you to contact Barrister Williams Darvis so that he can help you to deliver your funds instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>Thank You and Remain Blessed.</B></DIV>
